<P>Introduction: Psoriasis is a multifaceted immune-mediated skin disease and has been associated with other comorbidities. Previous studies in psoriasis reported the abundance of microbial taxa above the species rank (family Firmicutes and genus Staphylococcus), or the combined abundance of multiple taxa (Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus) were associated with psoriasis [1–3]. Characterizing the skin microbiome of psoriasis subjects and family controls can further our understanding of microbiota’s role in this disease. Objectives: This study aims to reveal the difference of skin microbiome between skin lesion area and normal area of the elbow as well as family controls. Methods: DNA samples was extracted from 21 elbow-skin. 14 of 21 were from 7 psoriasis subjects’ lesion side and normal side. The rest were from a healthy family member whom the subject lives with. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was adapted to resolute the skin microbiota. Partially overlapping t-test was used to investigate differentially abundant taxa. PERMANOVA was used to test the difference of microbial community composition </P>

<P>influenced bypsoriasisandsampling families. </P>

<P>Results: Bacteria phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were three most abundant microbial taxa in both lesion and normal skin. Bacteria phyla Cyanobacteria and Candidatus Parcubacteria, family Hymenobacteraceae were less abundant on lesion skin than normal skin (p&lt; 0.05). Sampling families </P>

<P>had significantly differentelbow-skin microbialcomposition for bacterialgenuslevelprofile(p= 0.001). Conclusions: Several bacterial taxa different from those previously discovered are more abundant on normal skin than lesion skin in the elbow. </P>

<P>NAIL DISORDERS IN PATIENTS WITH PSORIASIS VULGARIS </P>

<P>Jasmina Muhovic University Clinical Centre Sarajevo Introduction: Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin </P>

<P>disease characterized by T-cell-mediated hyperpfoliferation of keratinocytes in the skin. Approximately, 10–78% of patients with psoriasis have concurrent nail psoriasis while isolated nail involvement is seen in 5–10% of patients. Affected nail plates often thicken and crumble and because they are very visible patients tend to avoid normal day-to-day activities and social interactions. Importantly, 70–80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis have nail psoriasis. In this overview, we review the clinical manifestations of psoriasis affecting the nails. Objectives: To correlate frequency of certain nail dissorders in patients with psoriasis vulgaris. The observed dissorders were:onicholysis, subungual hyperkeratosis, oil spots, and pitting in both male and female patients aged 15–75 and combined with psoriatic arthritis. Methods: A total of 60 patients who were treated in our Inpatients Service with diagnosis of Psoriasis vulgaris from January 2017 to July 2017 at Dermatology Department, University Clinical of </P>

<P>Sarajevo.Wesearched forspecific nail dissorders. </P>

<P>Results: A total number of 60 patients with Psoriasis vulgaris, both male and female aged 15–75 werw examined. Out of that </P>

<P>number,43patientsreportedtohavespecificnaildissordersand/ </P>

<P>or psoriatic arthritis, and 17 of them were without any nail dissorders or psoriatic arthritis. Among the number of 43 examined psoriatis patients with nail dissorders, there were 23 female and 20 male patients, all of them aged between 45–60. Seven female and eight male patients had previously diagnosed psoriatic arthritis combined with psoriasis and nail disorders, while the rest of them, 28 patients, only had psoriasis followed by progressive changes on their nails, but without any signs of psoriatic arthritis. The presented nail dissorders in all patients included in these two groups were: subungual hyperkeratosis, onicolysis and pitting all combined in 14 patients, only subungual hyperkeratosis in 10 patients, pitting in 7 patients, 7 of them showed only onycholysis on both hands and 6 patients had oil spotting and pitting together. In patients without psoriatic arthritis the prevalence of dissorders in all affected groups was in male patients. Conclusion: Nail psoriasis engenders both physical and psycho</P>

<P>PSORIASIS HIDDEN IN GOTTRON’S PAPULES </P>

<P>Florentina Berianu, Juan J. Maya </P>

<P>Mayo Clinic Florida Introduction: Patients with Dermatomyositis (DM) present with rashes in a photosensitive distribution and occasionally a scaly rash over elbows, knees and scalp can resemble psoriasis. The biopsy of such lesions shows interface dermatitis which is highly distinguishing for DM. In rare occasions, patients can suffer from both DM and psoriasis (Ps). Objectives: To report a case of Dermatomyositis and Psoriatic arthritis Method: 45 years old female presented with a red, itchy rash with diffuse swelling over the entire body associated with swallowing </P>

<P>difficulties and weakness affecting mainly the proximal muscles </P>

<P>of upper and lower extremities. She has pain and stiffness in her </P>

<P>arthritis. Results: Ps and PsA were associated with DM in this patient. These are distinct diseases that have parallel courses and require different therapeutic approaches. Conclusion: Ps has been reported in association with Connective Tissue Diseases. Gotron’s papules can resemble Ps in patients with DM but rare case reports have described concomitant DM and Ps. The association of DM, Ps and PsA was even more rarely described. </P>

<P>Mogilev Regional Centre of Dermatology and Venerology Introduction. In recent years special attention has been paid not only to the systemic nature of the process in psoriasis, but also to its association with comorbidities. Comorbidity is a regular combination of various diseases or conditions in one patient, it </P>

<P>occurs inmanyinflammatory processes. </P>

<P>Objectives: The study of the incidence of concomitant diseases in patients with psoriasis in relation to patients with allergic contact dermatitis, analysis by age group. Methods: A retrospective analysis of data of 804 patients, who were treated in 2016–2017 in Mogilev Regional Dermatology and Venerology Centre with different forms of psoriasis, was conducted. 492 males, 312 females. The mean age was 43.05 years. The control group consisted of patients with allergic contact dermatitis, comparable in age and sex, in an amount of 397 people. </P>

<P>Results: Specificgravityandincidenceofcomorbidityinpatients </P>

<P>with psoriasis: cardiovascular damage 41% (331), gastrointestinal tract - 30.4% (245), endocrine system - 22.7% (183), metabolic syndrome - 28.2% (227), chronic otorhinolaryngological diseases -11.4% (92), diseases of urinary system - 6.2% (50), respiratory </P>

<P>system -4.7% (38). Significant differences between the groups </P>

<P>were obtained for all the comorbidity except respiratory diseases. Psoriatic polyarthritis were observed in 219 patients (27.3%), nail psoriasis – in 117 patients (14.6%). The average body mass index in the psoriasis group was 27.2, in the allergic contact dermatitis </P>

<P>group -25.3. Significant differences between the groups were </P>

<P>obtained for all the laboratory test changes except the general bilirubin, C-reactive protein and urinalysis. The percentage of diseases changed with increasing age: diseases of the cardiovascular system from 10% to 87%, gastrointestinal diseases from 20% to 61%, endocrine system diseases - from 14.5% to 38%, metabolic syndrome - from 11% to 34%, otorhinolaryngological diseases from 15% to 8.5%, diseases of the urinary system - from 1.8% to 8.5%, respiratory system diseases – from 1.8% to 13%. Conclusions: The analysis showed that in patients with psoriasis the most frequent comorbidity are: cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases, endocrine disorders, polyarthritis, nail psoriasis and metabolic syndrome. A rather high risk of comorbidity is established, in comparison with the population, which can directly affects the severity of the course of the disease, the effectiveness of the therapy and life expectancy. </P>

<P>RISK OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PLAQUE PSORIASIS </P>

<P>Veronica Lopez Castillo, Inmaculada Lopez Castillo, Pedro Rodriguez, Jose Maria Ricart Vaya Introduction: Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory, </P>

<P>multisystem disease affecting approximately 2% of population. It has been associated with certain diseases and there is a strong link between metabolic syndrome and psoriasis. Chronic periodontitis isaninfectiousdiseaseresultingininflammationwithinthesupporting tissues of the teeth, progressive attachment loss, and bone resorption and clinically characterized by pocket formation and/ or gingival recession. Psoriasis and chronic periodontitis share common risk factors and co-morbidities. Objective: The aim of our study was to determine how frequently chronic periodontitis is associated with patients with psoriasis compared to systemic healthy subjects and if its presence is associated to severity of psoriatic lesions. Methods: Baseline demographic data including sex, age, smoking habits, family history of psoriasis or periodontal disease was recorded in 40 psoriasis subjects and 40 healthy subjects. Information on comorbidities and pharmacological treatment, daily tooth brushing, the presence of gingival bleeding, location of skin lesions, weight and height were also evaluated. The periodontal clinical parameters probing depth, periodontal attachment level, plaque index and presence or absence of radiographic bone loss were recorded. The severity of psoriasis was assessed by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. A complete blood test was asked for all subjects included in the study. </P>

<P>Results: During the study enrolment period 40 patients with psoriasis and 40 age- and gender-matched controls were included in this study. Probing depth and periodontal attachment level </P>

<P>showed significant higher values in psoriasis group compared to </P>

<P>healthy subjects. Conclusions: We found evidence of a psoriasis-associated increased risk of periodontitis. Thus, dermatologists should be aware of this comorbidity because these patients should be closely followed-up by a dentist for the adequate and early treatment of periodontitis. Periodontitis may be associated with psoriasis but further studies are needed to elucidate their relationship. </P>

<P>Introduction: Cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities such as ischemic heart disease and diabetes are known to be associated with psoriasis. However, it is less clear whether this is due to common life-style related risk factors such as overweight and smoking. Objectives: We wished to investigate the association between psoriasis and cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidity in a cohort of middle-aged women, and at the same time taking the effect of body mass index (BMI) and smoking into account. Methods: The study population consisted of expectant mothers in a large nationwide birth cohort established between 1996 and 2002. During pregnancy, the women were asked whether they have ever had any skin diseases including psoriasis, and whether the disease was diagnosed by a physician. The relation to selfreported cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidity 11 years after giving birth was assessed by multiple logistic regression. Furthermore, we performed an analysis where the cohort was followed up for hospital-diagnosed comorbidity including cardiac death until 31st December 2014. Here the risk was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression. All analyses were adjusted for age, pre-pregnant BMI, and smoking status collected at time of inclusion during pregnancy. </P>

<P>Results: We identified 2,435 (2.90%) women with a history of </P>

<P>psoriasis and 81,388 women without psoriasis. The women with and without psoriasis were on average respectively 30.4 (SD </P>

<P>4.5) and 29.9 (SD 4.3) years old at time of inclusion in the study. Women with psoriasis had slightly higher BMI and smoked markedly more than women without psoriasis (38.1% vs. 26.4%). A </P>

<P>historyofpsoriasiswassignificantlyassociatedwithself-reported </P>

<P>hypercholesterolemia (adjusted odds ratio 1.31; 1.01–1.70) and hospital-diagnosed hypertension (adjusted hazard ratio 1.33; 1.08–1.65). A positive association was also found with respectively hospital-diagnosed ischaemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, however, these findings were not statistically significant. No associations were found for self-reported </P>

<P>hypertension, thrombosis, or type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: Women with psoriasis are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidity in early adult life. This may suggest an importance of awareness of these comorbidities also in younger patients with early screening for hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia. </P>

<P>A CASE OF CONCURRENT PSORIASIS AND VITILIGO </P>

<P>Selma Poparic </P>

<P>Dermatology Department University Clinical Center of Ssrajevo Introduction: Psoriasis and vitiligo are common dermatoses that affect 1~3% (psoriasis) and 0.5% (vitiligo) of the general population, respectively. Yet the pathogenesis of the association between these two dermatoses is still unknown. Case report: We report a case of a 52-year-old patient who was admitted to our department with a 6-month history of squamous papules and plaques on his right elbow region and both right and left lower leg. He was also noticed with hypopigmented patches on his right and left wrist. Anamnestic questionnaire revealed that his mother has had similar discolorations on her skin, but never underwent any diagnostic procedure, nor treatment. Clinical and hystopathological diagnosis of erythematosquamous areas on the patients right elbow and right and left lower leg was a plaque psoriasis, while hypopigmented patches on his wrists were diagnosed as vitiligo. Blood work up and T3, fT4, TSH, ANA laboratory tests were within normal ranges. Conclusion: Psoriasis and vitiligo, although seemingly unrelated skin disorders, have a lot in common. Causes, incidence, and even distribution seem to strongly correlate between these two. </P>

<P>nutrition and psychiatry, to evaluate at the same time and place, patients with psoriasis. Objetive: To ascertain frequency of comorbilities in psoriatic patients and conduct a clinical and epidemiological characterization. Methods: Prospective study, from August 2016 to february 2018, patients attending to Multidisciplinary Clinic for psoriasis in Dermatologico Country were included. Results: 53 patients were included. Median age was 42 years old and 62.3% were female. Family history of psoriasis was found in 26.4% patients and 19.4% had spodyloarthropathy family history. Most common comorbidities found obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension and fatty liver. Affective assessment was found for 49.1% met criteria for anxiety. Psoriasis found 96.2% with psoriasis in skin and 56.6% in nails. Most common presentation of psoriasis, was plaque psoriasis in 66%. PASI score showed 50.9% with mild disease, 15.1% moderate, and 34% had severe. NAPSI score was from 0 to 61, with a median of 3 (0.13). DLQI indicated that only 13.2% had no condition in life quality, meanwhile 86.8% patients had impaired quality of life. Psoriatic arthritis, and identify 58.5% patients that met CASPAR criteria, axial disease was present in 51.6%, peripheral joint disease in 71% and in 13.2% both were present. 54.8%(17) patients had enthesitis and 16.1% had dactilitis. DAS28 was performed, and showed 45.2% with severe activity. Total number of subjects with peripheral disease 100%, did not met criteria for MDA. HAQ score to assess PsA patients quality of life, revealed a median of 1.38 (1.10, 2.25). Conclusions: we found that more than half of the patients presented a severe form of psoriasis with significant quality of life impairment. The number of psoriatic arthritis was higher than expected with both axial and peripheral manifestations. We have found a high proportion of patients with comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity. We also found a high frequency of psychiatric illness. The limitations of our study are the small sample to highlight if comorbidities had an impact on the severity of skin and joint </P>

<P>disease. This multidisciplinary model has identified psoriasis as </P>

<P>a disease with an unpredictable course, which requires several evaluations by a multidisciplinary model, with a group of experts beyond Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. </P>

<P>Background: We have earlier in a limited cross-sectional study shown a correlation in females for alcohol consumption and extent of psoriasis. There are few prospective studies on the relation of alcohol with the extent of psoriasis. Objectives: The purpose of this prospective study was to further investigate how alcohol affects psoriasis in female patients. Methods: Twenty-two female psoriasis patients with light to moderate psoriasis, with only local treatment and with a regular alcohol intake, were recruited. The study was run for three years, starting in 2014. We used Christmas and New Year, as intervention period, when the amount of alcohol is expected to exceed normal consumption. The total study period was 8 weeks. During the study </P>

<P>period, the alcohol intake was measured by the patients filling a </P>

<P>calendar, specifying the alcohol intake per day, moreover, the degree of severity of psoriasis, degree of pruritus, and of perceived stress, using a visual analog scale. In addition, the patients once a week determined Self-Administered Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (SAPASI). Results: The alcohol intake, which was generally low to moderate, increased during Christmas and New Year, reaching its maximum during week 52 (Christmas week). There was a marginal increase in the extent of psoriasis, determined by SAPASI, during week 52. There was no correlation with alcohol intake nor pruritus. The level of perceived stress decreased shortly after week 52, and reached its lowest value during week 1, after that increasing. Conclusion: Even if there is an increased alcohol consumption during Christmas and New Year, there is no evident worsening of psoriasis. </P>

<P>PSORIASIS AND CANCER. RETROSPECTIVE STUDY IN THE PSORIASIS SECTOR OF THE DERMATOLOGY SERVICE AT RAMOS MEJIA HOSPITAL </P>

<P>Jennifer Kreimer, Alejandra Crespo, Elena Chaparro, Daniela Gonzalez, Veira Rosana, Kogan Nora Introduction: Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, immune-mediated </P>

<P>inflammatory disease that compromises the skin, attachments, </P>

<P>semi-mucosal, mucous membranes and joints. There are different clinical forms that can vary in the same patient at different times of life. It is accompanied by comorbidities that affect the quality and survival of patients. Within the comorbidities associated with psoriasis, malignancies constitute a prominent and controversial group. In the review of the current literature, there would be evidence of a relationship between psoriasis and cancer, given the existence of structural and molecular similarities between the two pathologies. Objectives: To assess the prevalence of cancer development in patients with psoriasis in our population. Methods: A retrospective epidemiological analysis of the total population of 1969 patients with psoriasis is carried out, attended in the psoriasis sector of the dermatology service of Ramos Mejía Hospital in the period between January 2008 and January 2018. </P>

<P>Results: We identified 56 patients who presented coexistence of </P>

<P>oncological pathology and psoriasis of different severity: 38 severe, 14 moderate and 4 mild. The population was divided equally between both sexes. Of these 56 patients, 61 tumors were detected (non-melanoma skin cancer, solid tumors and lymphomas). The oncological manifestations are the following: table 1. Table 1. Oncological manifestations Oncological manifestations Tumor quantification Total % Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma 4 7% Basal Cell Carcinoma 12 20% Breast Cancer 9 15% Prostate Cancer 12 20% Thyroid Cancer 6 10% Endometrial Cancer 3 5% Lung Cancer 1 2% Colon Cancer 4 7% Lymphoma No Hodgkin 1 2% Cervical Cancer 2 3% Kidney Cancer 1 2% Multiple Myeloma 1 2% Testicular Cancer 2 3% Tumoral Micosis Fungoide 1 2% Acute Myeloid Leukemia 1 2% Bladder Cancer 1 2% TOTAL 61 100% The epidemiological analysis of this group of patients showed an incidence for all types of malignancies of 3.098% in this population. The diagnosis of psoriasis preceded the oncological diagnosis in 50 of the patients studied. </P>

<P>Conclusions: The incidence of cancer in the general population in Argentina, according to the Ministry of Health is 172.3–242.9 per 100,000 inhabitants. In our study population, we found an incidence of 3.098%, which would support the hypothesis of an increased risk of developing cancer in patients with psoriasis. The risk was identical in both sexes and directly proportional to the degree of severity of the psoriasis. </P>

<P>Introduction: Psoriasis is a complex, systemic disease associated with comorbidities extending beyond the skin, often affecting psychological well-being which may manifest as clinical depression. Psoriasis can be viewed narrowly by focusing on the skin, or holistically to include associated comorbidities. To date, the complex interplay between psoriasis, comorbidities, and depression has not been adequately described, and an innovative approach is necessary to understand interrelationship between them. Objectives: Calculate incidence rates of depression in psoriasis patients compared to the general population and subsequently explore the risk factors associated with depression onset. Determine </P>

<P>thecontributionsofcomorbiditiescomparedtonarrowlydefined, </P>

<P>psoriasis-only symptoms. Methods: 96,666 psoriasis patients were matched to 15 controls and followed from psoriasis onset until incident depression diagnosis or censoring using population-based routine care data. Incidence of depression was calculated using Poisson regres</P>

<P>sion models. Risk of depression onset using a narrow definition of psoriasis was compared to a holistic definition including all </P>

<P>comorbidities using a Cox proportional hazards model, with additional adjustment for sociodemographic factors. Comorbidities were represented by ICD chapters with more than 5% correlation with psoriasis. Sensitivity analysis examined the role of psoriatic </P>

<P>arthropathy, alternative depression definitions, and searched for </P>

<P>unobserved confounding. Results: Patients with psoriasis have a higher incidence of clinical depression than those without the disease. Holistically, psoriasis was associated with an increased risk of depression onset of 40% (HR = 1.404, p&lt; 0.001), compared to 12% increase (HR = 1.115, p&lt; 0.001) when narrowly defined. The proportional hazards assumption appeared to hold in each survival analysis. A substantial portion, but not all, of psoriasis patients’ risk of depression onset was attributable to comorbidities, and sociodemographic factors did not appear to affect the estimates of association between depression and psoriasis. Major differences were found between </P>

<P>antidepressant-and diagnosis-based definitions of depression, </P>

<P>while inclusion of psoriatic arthropathy did not affect the results. </P>

<P>Nounmeasuredconfoundingwasidentified. </P>

<P>Conclusions: Due to the elevated risk of depression in psoriasis patients, treating physicians should ensure patients’ psychological well-being is addressed, especially in those presenting with additional risk factors, to break the cyclical relationship between depression and psoriasis and improve patients’ quality of life. Contemporary, holistic management of psoriasis patients should encourage routine screening for depression. </P>

<P>EFFICACY OF ADALIMUMAB PLUS METHOTREXATE IN PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE PLAQUE PSORIASIS </P>

<P>Ghasem Rahmatpour Rokni, Mohamad Goldust </P>

<P>Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences Background: Adalimumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody thatselectivelytargetstumornecrosisfactoralpha,isefficacious </P>

<P>in treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Currently there are some reports regarding drug resistance to adalimumab (1,2). Objective: This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of adalimumab plus methotrexate in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Methods: In this cross sectional study, 23 patients suffering from moderate to severe psoriasis were recruited. Patients received adalimumab 80 mg week 0, 1 and then 40 mg every 2 weeks and methotrexate up to 25 mg/week. The primary outcome measure was the difference in Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI75) response after 12 weeks. The secondary outcomes included PASI 75 at week 6 (onset of action) and week 12, Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA), Patient Global Assessment, impact on quality of life (Skindex-17 and SF-36), Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire of Medication, duration of remission, maintenance treatment and safety. Results: In the study group, 86.9% (20 out of 23 patients) reached PASI-75 at week 12. The longitudinal analysis showed a PASI reduction of 6.42% per week. The onset of action was achieved in 65.2%. At week 12, IGA ‘clear or almost clear’ was observed in 91.3% (p&lt; 0·01). Skindex-17 symptom score was significant with combination therapy (p&lt; 0·01). Maintenance treatment achieved PASI 75 for 82.6% (p&lt; 0·01). Mild adverse events were reported in 79.5%. Conclusion: Combination therapy of adalimumab plus methotrexate is a highly effective, well-tolerated, maintenance therapy in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. </P>

<P>Introduction: Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-choice therapy in psoriaticarthritis(PsA).Thereislimiteddataconcerningefficacy </P>

<P>of early administration and rapidly dose escalation of MTX subcutaneous (s/c) in early (E) PsA patients (pts). Objective: to study attainment of remission (REM) or minimal disease activity (MDA) after starting MTX s/c therapy in EPsA pts treated according to treat-to-target (T2T) strategy. Methods: 77 (M-37/F-40) pts with active EPsA, according to the CASPAR criteria were included. Mean age 37.4±10.8 years (yrs.), PsA duration 11±10 months (mon.), psoriasis duration 86±96.1 mon., DAPSA 32.45±12.7. At baseline all pts started MTX s/c therapy. The dose of MTX s/c was escalated by 5 mg every 2 weeks from 10 mg/wk to appropriate dose 20–25 mg/wk according to the drug intolerance. If the patient did not achieve remission or MDA on MTX mono-therapy, biological (b)DMARDs was added. At baseline and every 3 mon. of study (till 24 mon.) all pts underwent assessment of PsA activity by DAPSA and MDA criteria (tender joint count ≤ 1, swollen joint count ≤ 1, PASI ≤ 1 or BSA ≤3, patient pain global assessment VAS ≤15, patient´s global disease activity VAS ≤ 20, HAQ ≤ 0.5, enthesitis count ≤ 1). The proportion of pts who achieved REM by DAPSA ≤ 4 and MDA (5 of 7 cutpoints), the timing of REM/MDA, the mean dose of MTX during the study were performed. M±SD, Me [Q75; Q50], (%), W-test were calculated. All p&lt; 0.05 were considered to indicate </P>

<P>statistical significance. </P>

<P>Results: 36 out of 77 pts (46.75%) did not achieve REM or MDA in MTX therapy within 7±5 mon. and bDMARDs were added. 5 out of 77 pts (6.5%) stopped MTX therapy due to intolerance within 6±2 mon. 36 out of 77 pts (46.75%) went on taking MTX-monotherapy. In 22 out of 36 pts, who had mean DAPSA 27.7±10.0 at baseline, data was available by the 24 mon. of study. At baseline median dose of MTX s/c was 15 [10;20], Min 10–Max 20 mg/ wk. At the third mon. of study median dose of MTX s/c was escalated to 20 [20;20], Min 0–Max 25 mg/wk. After attainment of REM/MDA the dose of MTX was decreased. At the end of the study median dose of MTX s/c was 7.5 [0;15], Min 0–Max 20 </P>

<P>mg/wk (fig.1). After starting MTX disease activity by DAPSA significantly decreased by the third mon. and maintained till the end of the study (fig.2). DAPSA-REM and МDA was reached </P>

<P>within 9.7±7.7 and 13.7±7.6 mon. accordingly. By the 24 mon. of therapy stable REM by DAPSA and MDA was seen in 10 out of 22 pts (45.5%) and in 16 out of 22 pts (72.7%) accordingly. Conclusions: In half of EPsA pts early administration of MTX s/c and rapidly dose escalation is effective and well tolerated. After achieving REM or MDA, a decrease of the dose of MTX is possible in most cases. </P>

<P>as secukinumab may be necessary in women of childbearing age. Pre-clinical animal studies with secukinumab, which can cross the placenta, do not indicate harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/fetal development, parturition or postnatal development, however only limited data has been reported on human pregnancies. Objectives: Using the Novartis global safety database, we analyzed the outcome of pregnancies where there was maternal or paternal exposure to secukinumab. Methods: The Novartis global safety database (covering all secukinumab indications and including clinical trial and postmarketing data) was searched for cases reporting pregnancy and neonatal topics. All pregnancies where there was either maternal or paternal exposure to secukinumab were included in the systematic, independently validated analysis. The cut-off date was 25th June, 2017. Results: Of 292 pregnancies reported, 141 (48.3%) came from clinical trials, 79 (27.1%) were spontaneous reports and 72 (24.7%) were from post-marketing surveillance, with 238 cases of maternal and 54 cases of paternal exposure. 175 patients received secukinumab for psoriasis, 38 for PsA, 15 for AS and 62 for other/unknown indications. The majority of patients discontinued secukinumabinthefirsttrimesterofpregnancy;18didnotdiscontinue. Of 153 cases where the outcome was known, there were 73 full term normal neonates and 37 elective terminations. Rates of spontaneous abortions were 30/292, 10.3% overall (30/153 known outcomes, 19.6%). These are in line with previously reported rates (15–20%) for the general population with maternal age of 30.6 (study mean). No still births ( &gt; 20 weeks) were reported. Three congenital abnormalities were reported following maternal and 1 paternal exposure, with no repeated pattern of abnormality. At data cut-off, 32 pregnancies were ongoing. Conclusions: There was no evidence for increased rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes across indications with secukinumab in this review of the safety database. Given the limited exposure reported to date, the safe continuous use of secukinumab throughout pregnancy requires further research. </P>

<P>antibody that selectively targets interleukin-17A. Objective: To evaluate the effect of IXE on the impact of GP on sexual activity during 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo (PBO) in patients with moderate-to-severe GP. Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients (n= 149) with moderate-to-severe GP were randomized (1:1) to receive PBO or 80 mg IXE every 2 weeks following an initial dose of PBO or 160 mg IXE. The impact of GP on sexual activity was measured by pre-specified patient-reported outcomes including the Genital Psoriasis Sexual Impact Scale (GPSIS), which is composed of the Sexual Activity Avoidance (Avoidance) and Impact of Sexual Activity on Genital Psoriasis Symptoms (Impact) subscales, the Sexual Frequency Questionnaire (SFQ) item 2, and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) item 9. Of patients </P>

<P>with a baseline SFQ item 2 score ≥2, the percentage of patients </P>

<P>whose frequency of sexual activity was never (0) or rarely (1) limited by GP (SFQ item 2 0/1) was examined. Among patients </P>

<P>with respective GPSIS subscale scores ≥3 at baseline, response </P>

<P>was measured as the percentage of patients whose frequency of avoiding sexual activity was never (1) or rarely (2) impacted by GP (GPSIS-Avoidance 1/2) and whose GP symptom worsening after sexual activity was very low/none at all (1) or low (2) (GPSIS-Impact 1/2). DLQI item 9 response was measured as the percentage of patients with no (0) or a little (1) impairment of sexual activity. Treatment comparisons were made using a logistic regression model with missing values imputed by non-responder imputation. Results: IXE treatment reduced the impact of GP on sexual activity at Week 12 versus PBO as assessed by SFQ item 2 0/1 (IXE 78.4%, PBO 21.4%; p&lt; 0.001), GPSIS-Avoidance 1/2 (IXE 76.7%, PBO 25.7%; p&lt; 0.001), and DLQI item 9 0/1 (IXE 92.0%, PBO 56.8%; p&lt; 0.001). IXE was superior to PBO as early as Week 1 for SFQ item 2 0/1 (p&lt; 0.05), Week 2 for DLQI item 9 0/1 (p&lt; 0.001), and Week 4 for GPSIS-Avoidance 1/2 (p&lt; 0.01). GPSIS-Impact 1/2 response rates suggested a trend of reduced impact of sexual activity on GP symptoms (IXE 85.7%, PBO 52.9%; p= 0.062).

<P>Introduction: Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralizes IL-17A, a key cytokine involved in the development of psoriasis. Heterogeneity in clinical response to targeted therapies such as secukinumab may be addressed by </P>

<P>flexible dosing. </P>

<P>Objectives: To compare downtitration of PASI90 responders to 6-weekly and uptitration of PASI≥75 to &lt; 90 responders to twoweekly secukinumab dosing with standard 4-weekly dosing. Methods: OPTIMISE was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, rater blinded Phase 3b study. 1647 subjects received secukinumab 300 mg at baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 then 4-weekly to Week 24. At Week 24, PASI90 responders were randomized to secukinumab 300 mg q4w (n= 644) or q6w (n= 662) to Week 52; PASI≥75 to &lt; 90 responders were randomized to secukinumab 300 mg q4w (n= 114) or 2-weekly (q2w) (n= 92) to Week 52. Groups were stratifiedbybody weight(&lt; 90kg, ≥90kg). Results: PASI90 response was maintained at Week 52 by 85.7% subjects with q4w dosing vs 74.9% with q6w dosing; OR 1.91 (95% CI 1.44, 2.55). The primary endpoint, non-inferiority of q6w </P>

<P>vs q4w dosing in PASI90 responders, was not met. In PASI≥75 </P>

<P>to &lt; 90 responders, 46.5% of subjects achieved PASI90 response by Week 52 with q4w dosing. PASI90 response at Week 52 was numerically higher for q2w compared to q4w dosing (56.5% vs. </P>

<P>Introduction: TNF-alpha cytokine plays an important role in the regulation of activation, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of the immune cells. It is an important therapeutical target in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. From its other roles, it plays key part in formation and maintenance of granuloma through the increased fagocytic capacity of macrophages and eradication of intracellular pathogens, therefore its inhibitors pose a risk for granulomatous infections and reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Objectives: The main focus was to assess the infectious complications of biologic anti-TNF-alpha treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis with focus on the tuberculosis and reactivation of its latent form. Moreover, the authors tried to establish possible risk factors on the reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Methods: The authors analyzed the group of 190 patients from Middle-European population treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors, as compared to other biologics, for the occurence of infectious complications. Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) test was performed before the start of the treatment and then every year, in accordance with The Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group (TBNET) consensus. Statistical analysis was performed on the results. Results: 3% of patients had permanently positive IGRA test (before and after beginning of the treatmet) and in 28% of patients treated by TNF inhibitors, conversion of IGRA test appeared with negative test before treatment and positive test after administration of biologics. No active tuberculosis was detected. The average time of IGRA conversion was 3 years after beginning of treatment. The </P>

<P>only statistically significant predictor was age, with an increase </P>

<P>of age by one year associated with the 5.8% increase of risk of IGRA conversion. Regarding other infectious complications, the most common infections in patients treated with biologics were respiratory and HPV infections. No severe infection leading to the permanent discontinuation of treatment was observed. Conclusions: Treatment with TNF-alpha inhibitors was associated </P>

<P>Introduction: Patients’ perspectives on psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) treatment are important in establishing better approaches to their care. Objectives: To assess treatment use and satisfaction among patients with PsO/PsA in Scandinavia. Methods: NORPAPP was an on-line survey carried out in Nov/ Dec 2015 using YouGov panels in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. Adults with physician-diagnosed PsO or PsA (n= 1221), answered questions about contact with the healthcare system, and treatment experience and satisfaction. Self-perceived disease severity was dichotomised to severe (responses of “quite severe”, “very severe” or “extremely severe”) and non-severe (“not particularly severe” or “not severe at all”). </P>

<P>Results: Among respondents with PsO alone 38.9% had seen a dermatologist in the past year, and 10.7% had never seen a dermatologist; 60.9% of those with PsA±PsO had seen a rheumatologist in the past year; 14.3% had never seen a rheumatologist. Systemic treatments had been used by 14.6% of respondents with PsO alone and 58.5% with PsA±PsO. Respondents with self-perceived severe symptoms and patient organization members (POMs) were more likely than those with non-severe symptoms or non-members, to have discussed systemic treatments with their physician and to have used the treatments; however, 35.2% of respondents with self-perceived severe symptoms had never discussed systemic treatment with their physician. Asked about long-term health risks of systemic treatments, 18–44 year-olds and POMs were less likely to answer “don’t know” than 45–74 year-olds (47.7%–49.1% vs 66.7%–72.9%) or non-members (26.1%–30.7% vs 66.8%–70.4%). Biologics had been used by 40.7% of POMs vs 6.9% of nonmembers, and 21.5% of 18–44 year-olds vs 8.1% of 45–74 yearolds. Among respondents using oral/injectable methotrexate 30.5% </P>

<P>were dissatisfied, 60.2% citing side-effects as the reason; 22.9% of biologics users were dissatisfied, 28.9% citing lack of effect </P>

<P>and 28.1% citing side-effects. Conclusion: In Scandinavia POMs and young patients are more likely to receive systemic treatment. A high proportion of patients </P>

<P>at Wk16 were eligible for early escape. At Wk24, remaining PBO subjects switched to APR. Work productivity and activity impairment were assessed at baseline (BL) and Wk16 using the WPAI:PsA; WPAI:PsA Absenteeism, Presenteeism, Work Productivity Loss, and Activity Impairment subscale scores range from 0% to 100%; higher scores indicate greater impairment. Work-related subscales were assessed in employed subjects; activity impairment was assessed in all subjects. Correlations were examined at Wk16 between WPAI:PsA subscale and SF-36v2 domain scores (Physical Functioning [PF], Bodily Pain [Pain], and Vitality [VIT]) associations with ACR20 response. Work productivity improvement was assessed to Wk104. Results: BL characteristics were similar between groups. At Wk16, APR improved work productivity and ability to carry out daily activities vs PBO, with greater mean improvements in overall Work Productivity Loss (p= 0.001) and Activity Impairment (p&lt; 0.001). Estimated mean change in Absenteeism score was similar with APR vs PBO (p= 0.679). The Presenteeism score </P>

<P>Introduction: Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are associated with high prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome. In phase </P>

<P>3 trials, apremilast, an oral PDE4 inhibitor, was efficacious in </P>

<P>patients (pts) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (ESTEEM 1 and 2 [EST]) and active PsA (PALACE 1–3 [PAL]). Objectives: To explore potential effects of apremilast on metabolic parameters, we assessed weight change and A1c in pts receiving placebo (PBO) or apremilast 30 mg twice daily (APR) in a pooled analysis of EST and PAL. </P>

<P>Methods: Mean A1c change and mean percent weight change at Wk16 were compared among pts with baseline (BL) A1c &lt; 5.7%, </P>

<P>5.7%to6.4%(prediabetes),and≥6.5%(diabetes)andbetweenpts </P>

<P>reporting/not reporting concomitant insulin use. Spearman rank correlations between percent change from BL in weight and change in A1c at Wk16 were calculated; p&lt; 0.05wasconsideredsignificant. Results: In the pooled EST-PAL population, 2,242 pts (PBO n= 913; APR n= 1,329) received study medication at BL. In all, </P>

<P>230 pts had BL A1c ≥6.5%. At Wk16, A1c change in pts with </P>

<P>BL A1c &lt; 5.7% was 0.02 with PBO and 0.04 with APR. In pts with BL A1c 5.7% to 6.4%, small changes were observed (PBO </P>

<P>−0.07; APR −0.12). Greatest A1c changes were in pts with BL A1c ≥6.5% (PBO −0.08; APR −0.31). At Wk16, mean weight change was 0.11% (PBO) and −1.32% (APR). In pts reporting </P>

<P>and not reporting concomitant insulin use, mean weight change </P>

<P>was 0.05% and 0.12% with PBO, respectively, and −1.83% and −1.31% with APR. Weight change in pts with BLA1c &lt; 5.7%, 5.7% to 6.4%, and ≥6.5% was 0.02%, 0.26%, and 0.11% with PBO,respectively,and−1.24%,−1.35%,and−1.68%withAPR. </P>

<P>Correlations between changes in weight and A1c were generally low, with greater correlation in APR pts with higher BLA1c. Corre</P>

<P>Background: Observational studies comparing the effectiveness of adalimumab (ADA) to non-biologic DMARDs (nbDMARD) in PsA patients failing prior treatment are scarce. COMPLETE-PSA is a Canadian observational study which assessed effectiveness of ADA and non-biological therapies (NSAIDs and DMARDs) among PsA patients failing previous therapy. Objectives: To describe the baseline (BL) demographic and disease parameters and to compare 12-month real-life effectiveness of patients initiating nbDMARD or ADA. </P>

<P>Methods: Eligible patients eligible are anti-TNFα naïve adults, </P>

<P>with active PsA requiring a treatment regimen change, per the treating physician’s judgment. This analysis included patients enrolled during Jul/2011–Jun/2016. Outcome measures analyzed were: DAS28, SF-12, DLQI, presence of extra-articular manifestations (EAMs; enthesitis &amp; dactylitis), psoriasis BSA, achievement </P>

<P>of modified MDA(achievement of [i] 4/6 (MDA1) and [ii] 5/6 </P>

<P>following criteria (MDA 2): TJC ≤ 1, SJC ≤ 1, BSA ≤ 3%, pain VAS ≤ 15mm, PtGA ≤ 20 and HAQ ≤ 0.5), modified remission (SJC = 0, TJC = 0, absence of enthesitis and dactylitis, BSA ≤ 3% and HAQ ≤ 0.5), DAPSA LDA ( ≤ 14), and DAPSA remission (REM; ≤ 4). Analyses were conducted by initial group assignment (intent-to-treat approach). Results: 406 patients were included (nbDMARD n= 146, ADA n= 260). BL demographics were comparable between treatment groups. However, patients initiating ADA were more likely to be unemployed (47.3% ADA vs 34.9% nbDMARD, p= 0.015), had higher DAS28 (4.8 vs 4.4, p= 0.002) and total DLQI score (6.1 vs 4.3, p= 0.007),andweremorelikelytohaveBSA≥3%(44.6% vs 35.0%, p= 0.063) and high DAPSA disease activity (50.8% vs 32.3%, p= 0.015). A higher proportion of nbDMARD patients had dactylitis (36.1% vs 25.3%, p= 0.023). No differences were observed between groups in enthesitis, overall EAMs, or QoL at BL. Following 12 months, mean adjusted DAS28 (2.6 vs 3.4, p&lt; 0.001) and DLQI (2.2 vs 2.9, p= 0.530) scores, but not SF-12, were lower in the ADA group. Furthermore, even though statistical </P>

Conclusions: PsA patients initiating ADA in Canadian routine clinical care have significantly greater BLdisease severity compared with those initiating nbDMARDs. However, 12-month ADA treatment resulted in improved disease control and EAMs. DAPSA-REM evaluation seems more sensitive than mMDA in differentiating both populations. </P>

<P>Background: Previous studies have shown the efficacy of antiTNFα agents in improving nail, skin and joint manifestations of </P>

<P>psoriatic arthritis (PsA). However, real-world data on the comparative effectiveness of switching to or adding these agents vs. continuing non-biologic treatments in patients having failed prior non-biologic treatment are necessary to support the integration of treatment algorithms into routine care. Objectives: The aim of this analysis was to compare the effect of adalimumab (ADA) vs. non-biologic treatments (nbDMARD: NSAIDs and DMARDs) on skin outcomes and patient reported outcomes following initial treatment failure. In addition, the impact of the extent of baseline skin disease on treatment outcomes was examined. </P>

<P>Methods: Patients eligible for COMPLETE PsA are anti-TNFα naïveadults,withactivePsAwhorequirechangeintheirtreatment </P>

<P>regimen, per the judgment of the treating physician. In the current analysis patients enrolled between July/2011 – Jun/2016 who had available information on baseline psoriasis body surface area (BSA) were included. Outcome measures analyzed were: BSA, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Analyses were conducted by initial group assignment (intent-to-treat approach). Results: A total of 392 patients were included (ADA n= 249, nbDMARD n= 143). Baseline demographics and disease duration were comparable between treatment groups. However, patients </P>

<P>initiating ADA were more likely to have BSA≥3% (44.6% vs. </P>

<P>35%, p= 0.063) and had higher DLQI (6.2 vs. 4.3, p= 0.006) scores. No differences were observed in SF-12 physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component scores at baseline. </P>

<P>During treatment, BSA levels significantly improved in both </P>

<P>groups but more patients achieved a BSA &lt; 3% when treated with ADA vs. nbDMARD both at 6 months (89.7% vs. 80.2%, p= 0.027) and 12 months (89.0% vs. 83.7%, p= 0.222). Furthermore, upon adjusting for baseline scores, patients in the ADA groupexperiencedgreaterimprovementsinDLQI(ΔLSM= -1.62, p= 0.004), particularly in the daily activities, leisure, and work/ schooldomains,andSF-12PCS(ΔLSM= 0.36, p&lt; 0.001).

<P>Introduction: Treatment goals in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are moving toward attainment of absolute therapeutic thresholds rather than relative improvement. Objective:To explore the effect of ixekizumab (IXE), an anti-IL17A monoclonal antibody, as assessed by composite endpoints, up to 52 weeks (wks) for the SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2 trials. </P>

<P>Methods: Data were analyzed from 2 double-blind, phase 3 trials </P>

<P>(pts). For SPIRIT-1 [1] biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug-naïve pts were randomized to placebo (PBO, n= 106) or 80 mg IXE every 4 wks (Q4W, n= 107) or every 2 wks (Q2W, n= 103) post 160 mg starting dose. For SPIRIT-2 [2] (inadequate responders to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors [TNFi]) pts were randomized to PBO (n= 118) or 80 mg IXE Q4W (n= 122) or Q2W (n= 123) post 160 mg starting dose. Minimal disease activity (MDA), MDA very low disease activity (VLDA), Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) LDA, DAPSA remission, Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score (PASDAS) LDA, and PASDAS VLDA composite endpoints were evaluated. Imputation for categorical responses was non-responder imputation. Treatment comparisons (with placebo up to Wk 24) based on the intent-to-treat population were made using a logistic regression model. Data up to Wk52 are summarized. Results: At Wk 24, percentage of pts achieving MDA (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 29.9; Q2W: 40.8; PBO: 15.1; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 27.9; Q2W: 31.9; PBO: 3.4), MDA VLDA (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 10.3; Q2W: 11.7; PBO: 0.9; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 12.3; IXEQ2W: 3.3; PBO: 0.8), DAPSA LDA (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 31.8; Q2W: 34.0; PBO: 17.9; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 25.4; Q2W: 27.6; PBO: 11.1), DAPSA remission (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 15.9; Q2W: 24.3; PBO: 4.7; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 14.8; Q2W: 7.3; PBO: 0.8), PASDAS LDA (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 42.1; Q2W: 50.5; PBO: 18.9; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 39.3; Q2W: 35.0; PBO: 6.8), and PASDAS VLDA (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 11.2; Q2W: 20.4; PBO: 1.9; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 13.1; Q2W: 7.3; PBO: 0.0) was greater with Q4W and Q2W versus placebo. Similarly, at Wk 52 the response rates were either sustained or improved: MDA (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 39.3; Q2W: 36.9; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 34.4; Q2W: 23.6), MDA VLDA (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 14.0; Q2W: 15.5; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 12.3; Q2W: 6.5), DAPSA LDA (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 30.8; Q2W: 29.1; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 34.4; Q2W: 26.0), DAPSA remission (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 22.4; Q2W: 29.1; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 18.9; Q2W: 11.4), PASDAS LDA (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 43.0; Q2W: 50.5; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 45.1; Q2W: 30.9), and PASDAS VLDA (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 17.8; Q2W: 26.2; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 17.2; Q2W: 11.4). Conclusions: Regardless of previous TNFi exposure, a higher proportion of IXE-treated pts achieved MDA and MDA VLDA, DAPSA LDA and DAPSA remission, and PASDAS LDA and PASDAS VLDA at Wk 24 versus placebo. At Wk 52, the extent of IXE clinical response sustained or further improved. </P>

<P>Introduction: MP1032belongstoanewclassofanti-inflammatory </P>

<P>drugs that modulate the redox state of activated macrophages. </P>

<P>MP1032 attenuates pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in vivo and in vitro and has pronounced disease-modifying effects in various preclinical models. Objectives: This randomized, double-blind, parallel, and placebocontrolled trial aimed to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, and </P>

<P>efficacyoforallyadministeredMP1032inpatientswithmoderate</P>

<P>to-severe plaque psoriasis. Methods: Forty-six patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (PASI &gt; </P>

<P>10; disease duration ≥ 6 months) were equally randomized to </P>

<P>receive either 100 mg MP1032 or placebo by twice daily oral administration. The study design consisted of a 42 day treatment period with a follow-up of 28 days. Pharmacokinetic sampling occurred on day 1 at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min post-dose. Adverse events were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regu</P>

<P>latoryActivities.Efficacyparameterswereassessedatscreening </P>

<P>and on day 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, and 71. Results: Enrolled patients had an average age of 40 years (21–65 years) and a median baseline PASI of 13.6 (ranging from 10.1 to 40.8). Pharmacokinetic evaluation demonstrated that MP1032 was rapidly absorbed, reaching maximum plasma concentrations within 15 min after administration. Then, MP1032 plasma levels were quickly declining, indicating a fast elimination. Safety analysis did not reveal any clinically important safety issues. No serious adverse events or deaths were reported and the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) between placebo and the MP1032 treatment group was comparable. The majority of TEAEs were mild to moderate in nature (mostly common cold, headache, and itching). Analysis of clinical laboratory data and vital signs did also not reveal any adverse effects of MP1032. After only six weeks of treatment, MP1032 led to a PASI reduction of about 25% in patients who entered the study with a PASI of 10–15. In contrast, placebo administration reduced the respective PASI only about 12%. During the four-week follow-up period, median PASI scores in the MP1032 group trended back upward while the placebo group remained unchanged, suggesting a positive therapeutic effect of MP1032. Since, patients with a lower basal PASI had greater improvements during therapy than those with higher scores, MP1032 seems to be a treatment option for patients with mainly moderate psoriasis. Conclusion: After six weeks of treatment, there was a clinically relevant response in patients who entered the study with PASI scores of 10–15. Overall, MP1032 demonstrated an excellent </P>

<P>safety profile and was well tolerated. Hence, redox modulation </P>

<P>targeted at the innate immune response represents a promising new therapeutic mechanism for psoriasis and other chronic in</P>

<P>flammatorydiseases. </P>

<P>Introduction: Inflammatoryboweldisease(IBD)includingCrohn’s </P>

<P>disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are common comorbidities associated with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Compared with the general population, epidemiological studies have shown that patients (pts) with psoriasis or PsA are at a 2–4-fold increased risk of developing CD and a 2–3-fold increased risk of developing UC.1–5 Additionally, in pts with AS, there is a 3–5-fold increased risk of IBD compared with the general population.6 Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes interleukin-17A and is approved for the treatment of psoriasis, PsA, and AS. Objectives: To evaluate the incidence of IBD, CD, and UC in pts with psoriasis, PsA, or AS who received IL-17A-inhibition with secukinumab from 21 phase 3/4 clinical trials of secukinumab for psoriasis, PsA, or AS. Methods: This analysis evaluated pooled data from fourteen phase 3 and one phase 4 psoriasis trials, three phase 3 PsA trials, and three phase 3 AS trials. Pts with a history of IBD, but not active ongoing IBD, were eligible for enrollment in these trials. Data from all pts that received at least one dose of secukinumab were included in this analysis. IBD reporting includes cases of CD, UC, </P>

<P>and IBDnototherwise specified(NOS). </P>

<P>Results: A total of 7355 pts receiving secukinumab were assessed for the presence of IBD: 5181 with psoriasis, 1380 with PsA, and 794 with AS. Over the entire treatment period, the mean total exposure to secukinumab was 10,416.9 patient-years (pt-yrs) in pts with psoriasis, 3866.9 pt-yrs in pts with PsA, and 1943.1 pt-yrs in pts with AS. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) per </P>

<P>100pt-yrs(95%confidenceinterval)ofCD,UC,andIBDNOSin </P>

<P>secukinumab-treated pts were 0.05 [0.02, 0.11], 0.13 [0.07, 0.23], and 0.01 [0.00, 0.05], respectively in the psoriasis studies; 0.08 [0.02, 0.23], 0.08 [0.02, 0.23], and 0.05 [0.01, 0.19], respectively in the PsA studies; and 0.4 [0.2, 0.8], 0.2 [0.1, 0.5], and 0.1 [0.0, 0.3], respectively in the AS studies. Additionally, the incidence of IBD, CD, and UC did not increase over time. Conclusion: Pooled data from 21 studies indicated that the observed exposure- adjusted incidence rates of IBD, CD, and UC with secukinumab were low and did not increase over time in pts with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, PsA, or AS. </P>

<P>ANALYSIS OF THE POSITION OF THE FUMARIC ACID ESTERS IN CURRENT EUROPEAN PSORIASIS GUIDELINES </P>

<P>Cecilia Dietrich1, Adria Gual2, Laura Padulles2 </P>

<P>1Dermatologikum Hamburg, Germany, 2Almirall S.A., Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Since 1994 a combination of fumaric acid esters (FAEs) (dimethylfumarate [DMF] plus three salts of monoethylfumarate [MEF]) has been approved in Germany for moderateto-severe psoriasis, however is not widely licensed elsewhere. While a new formulation of DMF has been recently approved by the European Commission (June 2017) as monotherapy for adults with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, only UK (NICE) guidelines mention DMF to date.[1] Method: Current treatment guidelines for plaque psoriasis in several European countries are reviewed to determine if these guidelines include therapy with FAEs and how these may guide the use of DMF monotherapy in the future. Results: FAE status varies across Europe. Current European guidelines recommend FAEs for the initial and long-term treatment of psoriasis. These guidelines (based on consensus/expert opinion) </P>

<P>also recommend a gradual increase in dose.[2] Country-specific </P>

<P>guidelines vary in their individual recommendations. German guidelines endorse FAEs as 1st-line treatment for moderate-tosevere psoriasis, based on BSA &gt; 10% or a PASI score of &gt; 10, and recommend clinical assessments after 16–24 weeks of treatment.[3] UK guidelines approve FAEs only as a 2nd-line option </P>

<P>forsevereplaquepsoriasis(PASI≥10orDLQI≥10),[1]whilstin </P>

<P>the Netherlands FAEs are indicated only for initial treatment of moderate-to-severe disease.[4] Swiss guidelines also recommend the use of FAEs for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, but only in patients who are unresponsive to topical therapy.[5] In Sweden, FAEs can be considered as a 2nd-line treatment option.[6] </P>

<P>Other country-specific guidelines are less clear. While Spanish </P>

<P>guidelines discuss FAEs as a slower-acting therapy requiring </P>

<P>treatment goals tobe set at week 16, no specific guidance on the </P>

<P>use of FAEs is given.[7] Likewise, while Italian guidelines mention FAEs, they are not included in treatment recommendations as they are currently not licensed in Italy.[8] In contrast, there is no mention of FAEs in guidelines in Denmark, Portugal and Norway. Conclusion: European guidelines recommend FAEs for both the initial and long-term treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. In Germany, FAEs have been licensed for &gt; 20 years and are commonly used as 1st-line therapy. In the rest of Europe, there is growing acceptance of FAEs as a systemic therapy option in moderate-to-severe disease. Guidelines continue to evolve as experience grows outside Germany, and will need to be updated to guide the use of the newly approved DMF monotherapy in future. </P>

<P>pooled data from two Phase 3 studies, FUTURE 2 (NCT01752634) and FUTURE 3 (NCT01989468). Methods: SEC and placebo (PBO) were administered weekly duringthefirst4weeks(wks)followedbysubcutaneousmaintenance dosing every 4 weeks thereafter (PBO until Wk 16/24). The results are reported only for SEC 300 and 150 mg (approved doses). Pts with baseline (BL) enthesitis (BLE) or without BLE (No BLE) were included. Evaluation through Wk 104 included: time tofirstresolutionofenthesitis(i.e.EC = 0); shift analysis of BL EC (1, 2 or 3–6) to full resolution (FR) and partial resolution (PR; reduction of EC) at Wks 24 and 104; and number of new enthesitis sites developed in No BLE pts.

Lau5, Rita TarzynskiPotempa2 1Charité - University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany, 2University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada, 3Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA, 4Oregon Health &amp; Science University and Legacy Devers Eye Institute, Portland, OR, USA,5AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA </P>

<P>Introduction: Adalimumab is an anti–tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) agent indicated for the treatment of immune-mediated </P>

<P>diseases. The long-term safety of adalimumab was previously reported in 23,458 patients representing up to 12 years of clinical trial exposure in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), plaque psoriasis (Ps), and Crohn’s disease (CD). Objectives: Here we report an updated analysis examining the long-term safety of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, AS, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), peripheral SpA (pSpA), PsA, Ps, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), CD, ulcerative colitis (UC), and non-infectious uveitis (UV). Methods: Safety data from 78 clinical trials of adalimumab (RA, 33; AS, 5; nr-axSpA, 2; pSpA, 1; PsA, 3; Ps, 13; HS, 3; CD, 11; UC, 4; UV, 2; other, 1) were included in these analyses, including randomized controlled, open-label, and long-term extension studies conducted in Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa through December 31, 2016. Adalimumab postmarketing surveillance data were not included in this analysis. Safety assessments included all adverse </P>

<P>events(AEs)andseriousAEs(SAEs)thatoccurredafterthefirst </P>

<P>adalimumab study dose and up to 70 days (5 half-lives) after the last study dose. Results: This analysis included 29,987 patients, representing 56,951 patient-years of exposure. The majority of adalimumab exposure was in RA studies (37,106 PYs). The most frequently reported SAE of interest was infection (highest incidences in CD: 6.9, UV: 4.1, RA: 3.9, and UC: 3.5). The overall standardized mortality ratio was 0.65, 95% CI [0.5, 0.74]. For most of the adalimumab populations (AS, PsA, Ps, UC, CD, and RA), the observed number of deaths was below what would be expected in an age- and sexadjusted population. For HS, nr-axSpA, pSpA, and UV studies, the small size of these trials precluded accurate assessment of the standardized mortality ratio, and the 95% CIs all included 1.0.

<P>Objective:To evaluate the levels of response to guselkumab (GUS) among adalimumab (ADA) PASI 90 non-responders in the VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 trials. Materials/Methods: In VOYAGE 1 (n= 837), patients were randomized to GUS 100 mg at Weeks (Wks) 0/4/12, then every 8 wks; placebo (PBO) at Wks 0/4/12 followed by GUS 100 mg at Wks 16/20 and then every 8 wks; or ADA 80 mg at Wk 0, 40 mg at Wk 1, and 40 mg every 2 wks through Wk 47. In VOYAGE 2 (n= 992), patients were randomized to GUS 100 mg at Wks 0/4/12/20; PBO at Wks 0/4/12 then GUS 100 mg at Wks 16/20; or ADA 80 mg at Wk 0, 40 mg at W1, and then every 2 wks through Wk 23. ADA PASI 90 non-responders initiated GUS at Wk 52 (VOYAGE 1) or at Wk 28 (VOYAGE 2) and continued GUS treatment through Wk </P>

<P>100. Here we report PASI 100, PASI 90, IGA 0 (cleared) and IGA 0/1 (cleared/minimal disease), Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI), and Psoriasis Symptom and Sign Diary (PSSD) outcomes among these ADA PASI 90 non-responders after initiating GUS treatment through Wk 100. Results: In VOYAGE 1, among 138 ADA-treated PASI 90 nonresponders who initiated GUS treatment at Wk 52, a PASI 90 response was achieved by 75.0% of patients at Wk 76, and 72.6% of patients at Wk 100. At Wk 100, 78.5% of patients achieved an IGA 0/1 response, 74.8% of patients reported a DLQI 0/1 score, 33.3% of patients reported a PSSD symptom score of 0, and 18.9% reported a PSSD sign score of 0. In VOYAGE 2, among 112 ADA-treated PASI 90 non-responders who initiated GUS at Wk 28, a PASI 90 response was achieved by 66.1% of patients at Wk 48 and 75.5% of patients at Wk 100. At Wk 100, 81.0% of patients achieved an IGA 0/1 response, 65.3% of patients reported a DLQI 0/1 score, 32.6% of patients reported a PSSD symptom score of 0, and patients 18.0% reported a PSSD sign score of 0.

<P>Objective:To evaluate the consistency of response of guselkumab (GUS) across predetermined weight quartile subgroups of psoriasis patients. </P>

<P>Materials/Methods: In VOYAGE 1 (n= 837) and VOYAGE 2 (n= 992), patients were randomized to GUS 100 mg at Weeks 0/4/12/20; placebo (PBO) at Weeks 0/4/12 followed by GUS 100 mg at Weeks 16/20; or ADA 80 mg at Week 0, 40 mg at Week 1, and 40 mg every 2 weeks through Week 23. The co-primary endpoints were the proportions of GUS vs PBO patients achieving: </P>

<P>1) ≥90% improvement in PASI score (PASI 90), and 2) cleared/ </P>

<P>minimal disease (IGA 0/1) responses at Week 16. Response rates across endpoints were evaluated for predetermined subgroups by baseline weight quartiles. Results: Pooled data from the two studies at Week 16 and Week 24 demonstrated that patients in the guselkumab group achieved substantially higher clinical responses compared with placebo at Week 16 and ADA at Week 24 across all quartiles of weight as cutoffs. AtWeek 16, for each quartile, defined by &lt; 74.6, ≥74.6–&lt; 86.4, ≥86.4–&lt; 100,and≥100kg,theproportionsofGUSpatientswith </P>

The proportions of PBO patients with a PASI 90 response by these quartiles were 5.0%, 2.9%, 1.2%, and 0.9%, respectively and the proportions with an IGA 0/1 response were 11.6%, 10.5%, 4.9%, and 3.5%, respectively. At Week 24, the proportions of GUS patients with a PASI 90 response by weight quartile were 79.7%, 81.1%, 75.1%, and 73.4%, respectively and the proportions with an IGA 0/1 response were 85.9%, 88.1%, 83.1%, and 78.3%, respectively. The proportions of ADA patients with a PASI 90 response by these quartiles were 62.4%, 66.0%, 52.7%, and 35.5%, respectively and the proportions with an IGA 0/1 response were 70.9%, 76.5%, 61.1%, and 45.2%, respectively. </P>

<P>Background: VOYAGE 1 and 2 were two phase 3 double-blinded, placebo/active comparator-controlled trials evaluating guselkumab (GUS), a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL)-23, compared with adalimumab (ADA) in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Here, we report speed of response results based on Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) outcomes through Week 24 from pooled VOYAGE 1 and 2 data. Methods: In VOYAGE 1 and 2, patients with plaque psoriasis were randomized at baseline to GUS 100 mg (Weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks [q8w]; pooled n= 825), ADA (80 mg Week 0, 40 mg Week 1, then 40 mg every 2 weeks [q2w]; pooled n= 582), or placebo (Weeks 0, 4, and 12, then GUS 100 mg at Weeks 16 and 20; pooled n= 422).EfficacywasevaluatedusingPASI75,PASI 90,andPASI100responses(patientsachieving≥75%,≥90%,and </P>

<P>100% PASI improvement from baseline, respectively) through </P>

<P>Week 24. Median time to achieve a response was defined as the timetakenfor ≥50%ofthepatientstoever achieve aresponse. </P>

<P>Results: Based on the pooled VOYAGE 1 and 2 data, median time to achieve a PASI 75 response was ≤ 8 weeks for both the GUS and ADA groups. However, median time to achieve a PASI 90 response was ≤ 12 weeks for GUS and ≤ 16 weeks for ADA. Median time to achieve a PASI 100 response was ≤ 24 weeks for GUS, but was not achieved for ADA. Median time to achieve any </P>

<P>defined endpointwas not achieved forthe placebogroup. </P>

<P>Conclusions: Taken together, these results demonstrate that patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated with GUS rapidly </P>

<P>achieved high levels of response, and more efficiently and more </P>

<P>quickly than with ADA. </P>

<P>Introduction: Efficacy of tildrakizumab (TIL), a high affinity, humanized, immunoglobulin G1κ monoclonal antibody against </P>

<P>interleukin-23p19, has been evaluated for chronic plaque psoriasis (PsO) in 2 phase 3 randomized controlled trials. Objective:The aim of our analysis was to determine predictors of response to TIL treatment in the 2 trials. Methods: Patients (pts) with moderate to severe PsO were randomized in reSURFACE 1 (phase 3; NCT01722331) and reSURFACE 2 (phase 3; NCT01729754) [1]. In Part 1 (Week [W]1–W12), pts received subcutaneous TIL 200 mg, TIL 100 mg, or placebo (PBO) at W0 and W4. Pts receiving PBO in Part 1 were rerandomized to TIL 200 mg or 100 mg in Part 2 (W12–W28). For each trial, continuous variables of mean baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), body mass index (BMI), Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA), and PASI component for head region as well as dichotomous variables of baseline PASI &gt; 20 or ≤ 20 and PASI 50 response or nonresponse at W8 were evaluated as </P>

<P>predictors of response. Response was defined in this analysis as </P>

<P>PASI 50 or PASI 90 at W12 and W28. Results: None of the continuous variables appeared to be consistently predictive of PASI 50 or PASI 90 response, nor were baseline PASI &gt; 20 or ≤ 20 definitive predictorsofresponse. PASI 50 response vs nonresponse at W8 with TIL 200 mg appeared to be predictive of a PASI 50 response at W12 (percentage of patients±SD: 98%±0.9% vs 59%±6.1%, respectively, in reSURFACE 1, and 99%±0.8% vs 57%±5.7%, respectively, in reSURFACE 2) and of a PASI 90 response at W12 (47%±3.3% vs 0%±0%, respectively, in reSURFACE 1, and 50%±3.3% vs 5%±2.6%, respectively, in reSURFACE 2). The percentage of patients with PASI 50 response vs nonresponse at W8 with TIL 200 mg who achieved PASI 50 by W28 was 99%±0.6% vs 90%±3.8%, respectively, in reSURFACE 1, and 99%±0.8% vs 86%±4.0%, respectively, in reSURFACE 2; the percentage who achieved PASI 90 by W28 was 70%±3.1% vs 23%±5.4%, respectively, in reSURFACE 1, and 70%±3.1% vs 21%±4.7%, respectively, in reSURFACE 2. Similar trends in predictive responses were observed with TIL 100-mg treatment. Conclusions: Achievement of PASI 50 by W8 was predictive of a PASI 50 and PASI 90 response at W12 and W28. Most of the patients who had not achieved PASI 50 by W8 were able to achieve a PASI 50 response by W28. Baseline PASI score, PGA, and BMI were not predictive of PASI 50 or PASI 90 response. </P>

<P>Objective:Toreportlong-termefficacyofguselkumab(GUS)after </P>

<P>drug withdrawal and retreatment in patients with moderate-severe psoriasis (PsO) in the Phase 3 VOYAGE 2 study. Methods: At Wk28, patients initially randomized to GUS who achieved a PASI90 response were re-randomized to either PBO/ withdrawal (with retreatment upon loss of ≥50% PASI improvement achieved at Wk28 or at Wk72 if retreatment criteria were not met) or continued GUS treatment through Wk72. Results: Among 375 patients initially randomized to GUS who achieved a PASI90 response at Wk28, 182 were re-randomized to PBO/withdrawal and 193 to GUS/maintenance treatment. Ef</P>

<P>ficacy for the continued GUS treatment group was maintained </P>

<P>through Wk72, while responses for the withdrawal group diminished, with PASI90 responses of 86.0% vs 11.5% respectively at Wk72. Among the 182 patients in the withdrawal arm, 117 were retreated with GUS prior to Wk72; 56 did not meet retreatment criteria and initiated retreatment at Wk72 per protocol. Of 173 patients retreated, 87.6% achieved PASI90 within 6 months of commencing retreatment. No new safety signals were observed with GUS withdrawal and retreatment through Wk100. Maintenance of PASI90 response after drug withdrawal was associated with continued suppression of IL-17A, IL-17F, &amp; IL-22, while loss of response was associated with increased levels of these circulating cytokines. </P>

<P>Conclusion: Superiormaintenanceofhighefficacyresponserates </P>

<P>Background: Various instruments are currently used for disease activity and outcome assessment in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Some measures attempt to incorporate the total spectrum of psoriatic disease manifestations [eg, minimal disease activity (MDA)] while others focus on arthritis assessments [eg, disease activity index for PsA (DAPSA)]. Whether in patients (pts) with PsA it is suf</P>

<P>ficienttoprimarilyconsiderjointdiseaseaspectsremainsunclear. </P>

<P>Objective:To compare DAPSA remission and low disease activity (LDA) with MDA and very low disease activity (VLDA) for the presence of residual abnormalities of the respective composing variables. Methods: This post hoc analysis included pts with PsA receiving adalimumab (ADA) in one of two multicenter studies: ADEPT was a 24-week (wk), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial; ACCLAIM was a 12-wk, open-label study conducted in </P>

<P>Canadaincaresettingsthatreflectedusualpractice.Frequencies </P>

<P>of DAPSA remission/LDA and MDA/VLDA were summarized, and the individual PsA manifestations within these states were assessed. DAPSA was summed from the following continuous variables: swollen (66) and tender (68) joints, pt global assessment (PtGA, cm), pt pain (PP, cm), and C-reactive protein (CRP, mg/dL).DAPSAremissionwasdefinedas ≤ 4 and DAPSA LDA as &gt; 4 and ≤ 14. MDA criteria were as follows: ≤ 1 tender, ≤ 1 swollen joint, ≤ 1 entheseal point, PP ≤ 15mm, PtGA ≤ 20mm, HAQ ≤ 0.5, and PASI ≤ 3. MDA was calculated as fulfilling 5 of the 7 criteria, andVLDAcalculated as fulfilling all 7 criteria. </P>

<P>Data were as observed. Results: Among 151 pts receiving ADA in ADEPT, 33 (22%) each achieved DAPSA remission and LDA at wk 24, and 20 (14%) and 11 (7%) achieved MDA and VLDA, respectively. Pts achieving DAPSA LDA appeared to mirror those in MDA, with the exception of experiencing numerically higher PP, PtGA, and PASI scores at wk 24. Pts in DAPSA LDA did experience numerically lower SJC when compared with the MDA achievers, and, like MDA achievers, displayed little residual enthesitis. Only VLDA, but not </P>

<P>MDA,couldmatchthestringencyofDAPSAremission,afinding that was confirmed through analysis of the ACCLAIM cohort. </P>

<P>However, VLDA allowed for numerically higher residual PP and PtGA levels when compared with DAPSA remission. Importantly, residual enthesitis did not differ among pts achieving DAPSA remission or VLDA. Irrespective of disease activity assessment, pts receiving ADA displayed little to no radiographic progression. </P>

<P>Conclusions: In the ADEPT and ACCLAIM cohorts, pts who achieved DAPSA remission or VLDA demonstrated similar outcomes with respect to the individual components of both scores, despite the omission of several of these within the DAPSA. Given the DAPSA’s continuous nature, its use may offer a good </P>

Methods: Patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were randomized in 3 large clinical trials: P05495 (phase 2; NCT01225731), reSURFACE 1 (phase 3; NCT01722331), and reSURFACE 2 (phase 3; NCT01729754) [1,2]. In this post hoc analysis, we sought to identify serious GI AEs and new-onset or exacerbation of pre-existing IBD from a pooled dataset of tildrakizumab-treated patients from these 3 trials, which followed patients up to 52 (reSURFACE 2) or 64 (reSURFACE 1) weeks. This analysis evaluated patients who received tildrakizumab 100 mg and 200 mg in P05495 and the reSURFACE trials. Results: In this analysis, we pooled 1911 patients from the 3 trials who received either tildrakizumab 100 or 200 mg. There were no new cases of IBD reported; among 6 patients with a history of IBD randomized to tildrakizumab, none experienced an exacerbation. The numbers (rate per 100 patient-years) of patients with serious GI AEs in the pooled dataset were 8 (0.80) for tildrakizumab 100 mg and 4 (0.43) for tildrakizumab 200 mg. These serious GI AEs included abdominal pain, constipation, diverticulum, dyspepsia, gastritis, thrombosed hemorrhoids, esophageal polyp, pancreatitis (1 patient each) among patients treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg, and abdominal hernia, upper abdominal pain, acute pancreatitis, and salivary gland enlargement (1 patient each) among patients treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg. Conclusion: In this post hoc analysis of patients from 3 large, randomized clinical trials, serious GI AEs were infrequent and there were no new cases of IBD or exacerbations of IBD.

<P>Introduction: Certolizumab pegol (CZP), an Fc-free, PEGylated, </P>

<P>anti-tumor necrosis factor, has shown efficacy in chronic plaque </P>

<P>psoriasis (PSO).[1,2] Objectives: To assess the proportions of patients (pts) achieving selected PASI thresholds over 48 weeks of CZP treatment. Methods: Data were pooled from CIMPASI-1 (NCT02326298) and CIMPASI-2 (NCT02326272), ongoing phase 3 trials in adults </P>

<P>withmoderatetoseverePSO≥6months(PsoriasisAreaSeverity Index [PASI]≥12, ≥10% body surface area affected,physician’s global assessment ≥3/5). Pts were randomized 2:2:1 to CZP400 </P>

<P>mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), 200 mg Q2W (400 mg loading dose [LD] at Weeks 0/2/4), or placebo (PBO). Week 16 PASI 50 responders receiving CZP continued the same dose to Week 48. We present the proportions of patients reaching PASI ≤ 1, 2, 3 and 5 at Weeks 16 and 48. Responder rate estimates were calculated using a logistic regression model. Pts not achieving PASI 50 at Weeks 16/32/40/48 were subsequently classed as non-responders. Other missing data were imputed using multiple imputation (Markov Chain Monte Carlo method). Results: At Week 0, 175, 186 and 100 pts were randomized to CZP 400 mg Q2W, CZP 200 mg Q2W, and PBO. Baseline mean PASI was comparable across CZP 400 mg Q2W/CZP 200 mg Q2W/PBO pts: 19.6 (SD:7.3)/19.2 (7.2)/18.6 (6.6). At Week 16, PASI ≤ 1 was achieved by 39.9% pts receiving CZP 400 mg Q2W and 36.2% CZP 200 mg pts, vs 2.6% PBO pts. Similarly, a higher proportion of CZP vs PBO pts achieved PASI ≤ 2, PASI ≤ 3 and PASI ≤ 5 (Table). In CZP-treated pts, PASI was maintained or further reduced to Week 48, with 48.2% CZP 400 mg Q2W pts and 39.9% CZP 200 mg Q2W pts achieving PASI ≤ 1 after 48 weeks’ treatment (Table). Conclusions: Higher proportions of CZP vs PBO pts met absolute PASI cut-offs over 16 weeks and response was maintained or further improved to Week 48. Although durability of response was observed with both doses, higher proportions of pts treated with CZP 400 mg Q2W than 200 mg Q2W were able to reach the most stringent cut-offs at Week 48. </P>

<P>anti–interleukin-23p19 monoclonal antibody that demonstrated efficacyinphase3trialsinmoderatetoseverechronicplaquepsoriasis (reSURFACE 1 [NCT01722331] and 2 [NCT01729754]) [1]. Objective:Here we investigated the relationship between TIL serum concentration, and efficacy and safety outcomes, in re-SURFACE 1 and 2. Methods: Placebo or TIL 100 mg or 200 mg was administered at Weeks 0 and 4, then every 12 weeks. Endpoints included proportion of patients achieving 75% Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) improvement from baseline (PASI 75 responders). </P>

<P>Pooled efficacy data for each dose from reSURFACE 1 and 2 </P>

<P>were grouped into quartiles based on average (mean) serum TIL concentration during Weeks 0–12 (Cav12). Associations between median Cav12 for each quartile (Q) and TIL dose were analyzed for PASI 75 response at Week 12 and adverse events (AEs). Results: TIL steady-state concentrations were achieved by Week 16 and were proportional to the dose administered. Median Cav12 (range) for TIL Q1–Q4, respectively, were 4.4 (2.1–5.2), 5.7 (5.2–6.4), 7.0 (6.4–7.8), and 8.7 (7.8–16.1) µg/mL for TIL 100 mg (n= 616) and 8.7 (4.2–10.4), 11.5 (10.4–12.5), 14.1 (12.5–15.5), and 17.3 (15.5–30.6) µg/mL for TIL 200 mg (n= 622). PASI responses were similar for corresponding quartiles across doses, with no relationship between serum concentration and patient response for Q1–Q3. Greater PASI 75 responses were associated with the highest Cav12 (Q4), particularly for TIL 100 mg where </P>

<P>PASI 75 response rates (95% confidence intervals [CI]) were </P>

<P>58.4% (54.6, 62.3), 62.3% (58.4, 66.1), 59.2% (55.3, 63.1), and 73.7% (70.1, 77.0) for Q1–Q4, respectively. Corresponding PASI 75 rates (95% CIs) for patients receiving 200 mg were 52.9% (49.0, 56.8), 68.6% (64.9, 72.2), 64.5% (60.6, 68.1), and 74.8% (71.2, </P>

<P>78.0) over Q1–Q4. There were no associations between AE rates and serum concentrations, and incidence rates of any AE, any infections, serious infections, upper respiratory tract infections, </P>

<P>malignancies, non-melanoma skin cancer, confirmed extended </P>

<P>major cardiovascular events, and drug-related hypersensitivity for TIL-treated patients were similar to, or less than, for placebotreated patients. Conclusions: No relationship was apparent between TIL dose or Cav12 and PASI response, although the greatest response was seen for the highest serum concentration. Importantly, there were no associations between serum concentration and AE incidence.

<P>Introduction: ESPRIT is a 10-year (y) international prospective observational registry evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness of originator adalimumab (ADA) in adult patients (pts) with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Objectives: To determine safety, effectiveness, and pt-reported outcomes (PROs) over an 8-y period from an interim analysis of data collected from the ESPRIT registry. Methods: ESPRIT enrolled pts who were continuing ADA treatment from a current prescription or previous study participation, or initiating ADA ≤ 4 weeks of entering the registry. The All-Treated pt population (All-Rx) received at least 1 ADA dose in this registry. Pts were evaluated at 3 and 6 months (mos) post-enrollment, and then every 6 mos for up to 10 ys. This interim analysis includes data collected from 26 Sep 2008 through 30 Nov 2016. Incidence rates (IR) for all treatment-emergent adverse events (All-TEAEs) in All-Rx pts are reported as events per 100 pt-ys (E/100PY) of overall exposure to ADA. Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) and PROs (US only) were evaluated in as-observed population (pt numbers were small at 96 mos). Results: For the 6045 All-Rx pts enrolled and dosed in ESPRIT, median duration of overall exposure to ADA was 3.9 ys. Registry discontinuation rate in All-Rx pts was 39.4%; with the most common reason being lost to follow up (18.2%). IR (E/100PY) for All-TEAEs was: overall 22.0; serious AEs 4.5; malignancies 1.1, serious infections 1.0; non-melanoma skin cancer 0.7; active TB &lt; 0.1; and All-TEAEs leading to death 0.2. Standardized mortality ratio was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.25–0.46), indicating the observed number of deaths was below expected in an age-, sex- and country-matched population. PGA clear/minimal was achieved by 57.0%, 58.7%, 59.1%, 62.6%, 61.9%, 63.8%, 65.5%, and 45.0% of pts at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96 mos, respectively. In 4202 US pts, mean change from baseline in Dermatology Quality of Life Index, total work productivity impairment, and total activity impairment at 12-mo intervals were -3.1/-5.5/-8.3, -3.2/-5.4/-9.1, -3.3/-5.3/-8.4, -3.5/-5.6/-8.7, -3.9/-5.8/-9.3, -3.7/-6.3/-8.7, -5.1/9.1/-11.4, and -5.9/-7.5/-13.8. Conclusions: In this 8-y interim analysis, no new safety signals were observed and safety was consistent with the known safety </P>

<P>profile of ADA. The number of TE deaths in the registry was </P>

<P>below the expected rate. As-observed effectiveness of ADA and improvement from baseline in PROs were maintained through 96 mos. </P>

<P>adults with chronic plaque psoriasis (PSO).[1,2,3] Objectives: To assess durability to Week 48 of the initial Week 16 clinical response with CZP in PSO patients (pts) in two identical phase 3 trials. Methods: Data were pooled from CIMPASI-1 (NCT02326298) and CIMPASI-2 (NCT02326272), ongoing CZP phase 3 trials in adults </P>

<P>withPSO≥6months(PsoriasisAreaSeverityIndex[PASI]≥12, ≥10% body surface area affected, physician’s global assessment [PGA] ≥3/5). Pts were randomized 2:2:1 to CZP 400 mg every </P>

<P>two weeks (Q2W), 200 mg Q2W (400 mg loading dose [LD] at Weeks 0/2/4), or placebo (PBO). At Week 16, PASI 50 responders receiving CZP continued the same dose through the maintenance period to Week 48. PASI 50 non-responders at Weeks 32/40/48 were classed as non-responders at subsequent time points. These analyses do not include PBO pts or Week 16 PASI 50 non-responders. We report number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve PASI 75 at Week 16, and PASI 75 at Week 48 in pts who achieved PASI 75 </P>

<P>atWeek16.Week16NNT,95%confidenceintervals(95%CI)and </P>

<P>Week 48 PASI 75 responder rates were estimated using logistic regression in which missing data and patients withdrawn due to relapse ( &lt; PASI 50 during the maintenance period) were imputed using multiple imputation (Markov Chain Monte Carlo [MCMC] method). Sensitivity analyses on PASI 75 were conducted using non-responder imputation (NRI). Results: At Week 16, NNT to achieve a PASI 75 response was 1.41 (95% CI: 1.26–1.60) for the CZP 400 mg Q2W dose group and </P>

<P>1.53 (1.35–1.77) for the CZP 200 mg Q2W dose group. Of the pts randomized to CZP 400 mg Q2W and CZP 200 mg Q2W at Week 0 who entered the blinded maintenance phase, 132/149 and 130/150 achieved PASI 75, respectively. Out of Week 16 PASI 75 responders, 98.0% of patients treated with CZP 400 mg Q2W and 87.5% of patients treated with CZP 200 mq Q2W also reported a PASI 75 response at Week 48 (Table). Sensitivity analyses using NRI showed similar trends with both doses, and similar trends were seen in PASI 90 response rates. Conclusions: These analyses show that patients in both CZP dose groups demonstrate durability of their initial Week 16 high-level response to Week 48, with greatest durability seen in the CZP 400 mg Q2W dose group (98.0% maintenance between Weeks 16 and 48). </P>

<P>Introduction: The Fc-free, PEGylated, anti-tumor necrosis factor </P>

<P>certolizumab pegol (CZP) has shown efficacy in chronic plaque </P>

<P>psoriasis (PSO). [1,2] </P>

<P>Objectives: To assess the efficacy of CZP to 48 weeks across </P>

<P>patient (pt) demographic and baseline disease characteristic subgroups in phase 3 trials. </P>

<P>Methods: In this prespecified, pooled subgroup analysis, data </P>

<P>were pooled from CIMPASI-1 (NCT02326298) and CIMPASI-2 (NCT02326272), ongoing phase 3 trials in adults with moderate </P>

<P>mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), 200 mg Q2W (400 mg loading dose at Weeks 0/2/4), or placebo (PBO). At Week 16, PASI 50 responders receiving CZP continued the same dose through the maintenance period to Week 48. PASI 50 nonresponders at Weeks 32/40/48 were classed as nonresponders at subsequent time points. Subgroups included age, weight, body mass index (BMI), baseline PASI, BSA and PSO duration. PASI 75, PGA 0/1, and PASI 90 responder rates were summarized at Week 16 using a logistic regression model with multiple imputation (overall population) and descriptively at Week 48 based on nonresponse imputation (subgroups). Results: 175/186/100 pts received CZP 400 mg Q2W/CZP 200 </P>

<P>mg Q2W/PBO. Efficacy was observed across all subgroups for </P>

<P>both CZP 400 mg Q2W and 200 mg Q2W, with higher Week 48 PASI 75 responder rates in CZP 400 mg Q2W vs CZP 200 mg Q2W treated pts (Table). Similar trends were observed for PGA 0/1 and PASI 90. Conclusions: Treatment with either dose of CZP resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in signs and symptoms of PSO at Week 16 maintained at Week 48. Similar to the overall population, PASI 75, PGA 0/1, and PASI 90 responder rates were greater for CZP 400 mg Q2W versus 200 mg Q2W across most subgroups at Week 48. </P>

<P>DISCONTINUATION OF BIOLOGIC THERAPIES IN CHRONIC PLAQUE PSORIASIS: A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT </P>

<P>Susanne Gulliver, Wayne Gulliver, Shane Randell </P>

<P>NewLab Clinical Research Introduction: Psoriasis is a chronic debilitating auto immune disease which manifests on the skin through red scaly plaques. Biologic treatment have been very successful in controlling moderate to severe psoriasis, however they are quite expensive and not all treatments work for all patients. This study looks to understand the demographics, treatment patterns, treatment failures, number of therapies and time to switching. A cohort of 459 patients treated with biologics was examined Objectives: 1. To understand the demographics, treatment patterns, treatment failures, number of therapies and time to switching. </P>

<P>2. To decipher patterns in biologic use in order to prescribe more </P>

<P>efficientlyand optimizehealth careresources. </P>

<P>Methods: This was a retrospective cohort of all patients exposed to biologic or PD-4 inhibitors within a single Dermatologist’s private practice. A simple summary of patient demographics including gender, treatment patterns, reasons and length of time before discontinuation was compiled. Reasons for discontinuation </P>

<P>included lack of efficacy (primaryor secondary), adverse events </P>

<P>(AEs), patient choice or other. Results: There were 189 females (41.2%) and 270 males (58.8%) with 914 incidences of biologic or PD-4 inhibitor treatment. The mean age was 53.48±12.6 and the mean treatment duration was </P>

<P>37.3 months±39.5 (approx. 3000 treatment years). </P>

<P>39.2%ofpatients(180)remainedonthefirstbiologic(range0.5 </P>

<P>to 15 years). The mean number of therapies was 1.99 (range 1–8), but increased to 2.63 if patients were not biologic naive. More male patients stayed on their first biologic (74.2% in ustekinumab-treated patients and in the Apremilast group 32.3%). Reasons for discontinuation: AEs (14.69%) and non-response </P>

<P>(30%); highest rates were in etanercept (78.0%), and infliximab </P>

<P>(75.4%); lowest rates was in etanercept 12.8% (14 of 109 patients), </P>

<P>highest ininfliximab34.9%,(44of126patients. </P>

<P>Conclusions: The most common cause for discontinuation of biologics was an AE and non-responsiveness (45.69%). Women were more likely to discontinue therapy than men. Males were </P>

<P>more likely to remain on the first biologic therapy.Adalimumab </P>

<P>and ustekinumab had lowest rates of discontinuation. Etanercept, </P>

<P>infliximab andapremilast hadthehighest. </P>

Methods: Patients (Pts) were randomized in P05495 (phase 2; NCT01225731), reSURFACE 1 (phase 3; NCT01722331), and reSURFACE 2 (phase 3; NCT01729754) [1,2]. In Part 1 (Week ([W]1–16) of P05495, pts received subcutaneous (SC) TIL 5, 25, 100, or 200 mg or placebo (PBO) at W0 and W4 and were rerandomized to various TIL doses in Part 2 (W16–52). In Part 1 (W1–12) of reSURFACE 1 and 2, pts received SC TIL 200 mg, TIL 100 mg, or PBO at W0 and W4. Pts were rerandomized in Part 2 (W12–28) and Part 3 (W28–64 or W28–52 in reSURFACE 1 and 2, respectively). Etanercept (ETN) 50 mg was an active control in Parts 1–2 of reSURFACE 2.

<P>Introduction: Etanercept (ETN) is an anti-tumor necrosis fac</P>

<P>tor medication that was among the first biologics approved for </P>

<P>psoriasis. Additional medications have been developed or are in development for psoriasis, and patients who do not adequately </P>

<P>respondto ETNmaybenefitfrom these more recent biologics. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of tildrakizumab (TIL), a high-affinity, humanized, anti-interleukin-23p19 antibody in </P>

<P>patients (pts) with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who were partial responders (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI]≥50–&lt; 75) or nonresponders (PASI &lt; 50) to ETN and were subsequently rerandomized to TIL in a phase 3 trial. </P>

<P>Methods: Ptswithpsoriasis(≥10%bodysurfacearea,Physician’s GlobalAssessment [PGA] ≥3, and PASI score ≥12) participated </P>

<P>in a 3-part, 52-week, randomized controlled trial (reSURFACE 2; NCT01729754) [1]. In Part 1 (Week [W]0–W12), pts were randomized to subcutaneous TIL 200 mg, TIL 100 mg, or placebo (PBO) administered at W0 and W4, or ETN 50 mg administered 2x/week. In Part 2 (W12–W28), TIL- and ETN-treated pts remained on the same treatment (TIL administered at W16; ETN 1x/ week), whereas PBO-treated pts were rerandomized to TIL 100 </P>

<P>or 200 mg. In Part 3 (W28–W52), ETN responders (PASI ≥75) </P>

<P>were discontinued, partial and nonresponders were switched to TIL 200 mg (administered at W32, W36, W48). For this post hoc analysis, the percentages of pts (±SD) with PASI responses and PGA response (score of 0 [clear] or 1 [minimal] with at least a 2-grade score reduction from baseline) were determined at W52. Primary results from the trial have been previously reported. Results: In all, 1090 pts were randomized. Of the 313 pts randomized to ETN, by W28 there were 83 partial responders and 39 nonresponders. At W52 (after 20 weeks of TIL treatment) for ETN partial responders, 75%±5%, 34%±5%, 15%±4%, and 58%±5% had achieved PASI 75, 90, 100, and PGA responses, respectively, with TIL 200-mg treatment. At W52 for ETN nonresponders, 54%±6%, 31%±5%, 10%±3%, and 56%±5% had achieved PASI 75, 90, 100, and PGA responses, respectively, with TIL 200-mg treatment. Adverse events were similar in pts switched from ETN to TIL at W28, compared with the pts who were maintained on TIL through W52. Conclusions: A substantial portion of patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who were partial responders or nonresponders to ETN may respond after switching to treatment with TIL 200 mg.

<P>Introduction: Tildrakizumab (TIL) is a high-affinity, anti–interleukin-23p19 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. Objectives: We assessed a subgroup of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis who reported prior treatment with apremilast (APT), a </P>

<P>phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, to evaluate its potential influence onefficacyin2large phase3clinical studies oftildrakizumab. </P>

<P>Methods: The reSURFACE studies were 3-part, double-blind, </P>

<P>randomizedcontrolledstudiesinpatients(≥18yearsofage)with </P>

<P>moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis [1]. TIL 100 and 200 mg were evaluated for 64 weeks (reSURFACE 1; NCT01722331) and 52 weeks (reSURFACE 2; NCT01729754). Part 1 (0–12 weeks) was placebo (PBO)-controlled, whereas Part 2 (12–28 weeks) rerandomized PBO patients to TIL. The washout period for discontinuation of APT before randomization in these studies </P>

<P>was 4 weeks. In this post hoc analysis, we analyzed the efficacy </P>

<P>responses to TIL in patients who reported prior exposure to APT. Physicians’ Global Assessment (PGA) (0 or 1) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, 90, and 100 responses were assessed at Weeks 12 and 28 in this cohort. One patient with missing data at Weeks 12 and 28 was considered to be a nonresponder at these visits. The TIL groups were pooled owing to the small numbers reporting prior APT exposure. Results: The pooled reSURFACE 1 and 2 dataset includes 1238 patients randomized to TIL; of these, prior APT exposure was reported by 35 patients (n= 21 for 100 mg and n= 14 for 200 mg). In the overall pooled population of TIL-treated patients, PASI 75, PASI 90, PASI 100, and PGA (0.1) responses were achieved by 783 (63%), 450 (36%), 161 (13%), and 715 (58%) at Week 12 and 898 (73%), 647 (52%), 303 (25%), and 784 (63%) at Week 28, respectively. In the population of TIL-treated patients with prior APT exposure, PASI 75, PASI 90, PASI 100, and PGA (0.1) responses were achieved by 21 (60%), 9 (26%), 5 (14%), and 22 (63%) at Week 12 and 27 (77%), 16 (46%), 7 (20%), and 22 (63%) at Week 28, respectively. There were no discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) among patients with prior APT exposure. </P>

<P>Conclusions: Efficacy responses with TIL were similar for the </P>

<P>small sample of patients with prior exposure toAPT and the overall pooled population from reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2. These results were consistent with the notion that no adverse effect on ef</P>

<P>controlled period (507 pts, stratified by weight and prior TNFi</P>

<P>exposure, randomized 4:1 to receive either risankizumab [150 mg at wks 0 and 4] or PBO) was followed by randomized withdrawal and subsequent re-treatment with risankizumab. Co-primary endpoints were PASI 90 and sPGA 0/1 responses at wk 16; missing data were imputed as non-responders. Results: At baseline, the mean age and weight were 49.2 years and 92.0 kg, respectively; 70.2% of pts were male. A history of diagnosed or suspected psoriatic arthritis was reported in 34.7% of pts and prior TNFi therapy was reported in 36.5% of pts. Mean baseline PASI and BSA were 20.2 and 26.1%, respectively.

<P>studies (reSURFACE 1 [NCT01722331] and 2 [NCT01729754]) [1].Somedichotomousefficacymeasures,eg,proportionsofpatients achieving a 75% Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) response, provide limited efficacy and disease severity information at a patient level. Analysis of patient-level PASI data could address these limitations. </P>

<P>Objective:To identify potential insights into efficacy assessment </P>

<P>and disease severity using a post hoc analysis of patient-level PASI data. Methods: ReSURFACE 1 and 2 methods have been described previously [1]. Patients who participated in either TIL phase 3 study received TIL 100 mg or TIL 200 mg at Week (W)0 and W4, and every 12 weeks thereafter, or placebo (PBO) at W0 and W4 then TIL 100 mg or 200 mg at W12 and W16. PASI score distributions were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Numbers of patients and mean and median PASI scores are shown in the Table. By W4 (1 dose), 55% of patients in both TIL arms had PASI &lt; 12, and would no longer meet clinical trial entry criteria. The percentage of patients with PASI &lt; 12 increased during TIL treatment: 87% at W12, 93% at W28 (100 mg); 90% at W12, 97% at W28 (200 mg). At W12, 32% (TIL 100 mg), 29% (TIL 200 mg), and 2% (PBO) of patients had PASI ≤1.0. By W28, 48% (TIL 100 mg) and 52% (TIL 200 mg) of patients had PASI ≤ 1.0. Median PASI scores at W28 were 2.0 (TIL 100 mg) and 1.0 (TIL 200 mg). Conclusions: These results suggest that PASI scores may provide additional information about disease severity, and resolution with treatment, that might not otherwise be available using dichotomous PASI assessments. Most TIL-treated patients had clinical </P>

<P>improvement by W4, and ≈50% had nominal disease severity </P>

<P>(PASI ≤ 1.0) by W28. </P>

<P>based on their week-28 PASI response: PASI &lt; 50, PASI 50–74, PASI 75–89, PASI 90–99, and PASI 100. Baseline characteristics, the proportion of patients with DLQI 0/1, and mean DLQI changes from baseline were examined for each PASI response group. Results: Overall, 575 patients on tildrakizumab 100 mg (male: 69.6%; mean baseline age: 45.6 years) and 581 on tildrakizumab 200 mg (male: 73.0%; mean baseline age: 45.9 years) were included. At week 28, 8.3%, 22.0%, 40.9%, 66.3%, and 86.5% (8.7%, 35.2%, 43.9%, 70.4%, and 85.9%) of patients with PASI &lt; 50, 50–74, 75–89, 90–99, and 100 achieved DLQI 0/1 for those on 100 mg (200 mg), respectively. Patients with higher week-28 PASI response also had greater mean DLQI reductions from baseline at week 28 (100 mg: 5.7-13.4; 200 mg: 5.4–12.9). Similar patterns were observed among patients continuously treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg or 200 mg from baseline to week 52, with better PASI-response patients having greater proportions achieving DLQI 0/1 and greater DLQI reductions sustained from week 28 through week 52. Conclusion: Tildrakizumab-treated patients with higher levels of PASI response also demonstrated better quality-of-life improvements. Achieving PASI 100 was not necessarily associated with </P>

<P>THE IMPACT OF PATIENT REQUESTS ON PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS TREATMENT </P>

<P>Lynn Price, Jennifer Robinson, Gianna Melendez </P>

<P>Spherix Global Insights Introduction: As a result of direct to consumer advertising, patients frequently request well-known brands for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, and these patients tend to be highly involved in their therapy decisions. Patient requests commonly relate to formulation preferences, and in an indication dominated by biologics administered either subcutaneously or intravenously, oral small molecules are in high demand. Objectives: One of the objectives of this study was to gain further insight into patient requests as a main driver for switching to and from biologics/apremilast. </P>

<P>Methods: An independent market analytics firm collaborated with US rheumatologists (n= 200) to conduct a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) (n= 1,008), who had switched from one biologic therapy or apremilast to another in the prior twelve weeks. Rheumatologists were able to submit up to seven PsA patient charts. Data were collected in April 2017 and included clinical and non-clinical patient demographics, as well as physician demographics and attitudinal survey responses. Results: PsA patients tend to be very involved when it comes to </P>

<P>treatmentdecisionsas60percentofpatientshadsignificantinput </P>

<P>or were the primary driver behind the recent decision to switch agents. Of those patient driven switches, only 36 percent of treating rheumatologists felt there was strong clinical rationale behind the switch; despite this, nearly half of rheumatologists state they tend </P>

<P>toapprovespecific patientrequests. </P>

<P>Two-thirds of collaborating rheumatologists believe patients would choose an oral agent over one that administered subcutaneously, thus switching to apremilast is particularly common when patients are involved in the decision. Patient requests were the primary driver behind 24 percent of all switches to apremilast, compared to just 12 percent when switching to a biologic. Furthermore, for rheumatologists who are not in favor of an “apremilast before </P>

<P>biologics” treatment approach, patient requests are significantly </P>

<P>more of a driver for the brand than those who have adopted an “apremilast before biologics” approach. Conclusion: PsA patients are highly involved in the decision to initiate and switch biologic/apremilast therapies, and treating rheumatologists tend to be open to granting such requests, regardless of clinical rationale.

<P>Introduction: Optimal clinical management of psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) requires understanding of their impact on patients. Objectives: NORPAPP aimed to evaluate disease prevalence and patient perceptions of severity in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. Methods: NORPAPP was an on-line survey carried out during November and December 2015 using YouGov panels in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. The survey included 44 questions covering self-perceived disease severity/symptoms, quality of life, contact with the healthcare system, and treatment. The initial survey population was randomly selected using framing quotas based on population census data to ensure inclusion of a representative sample of adults (aged 18–74 years) from each country. Participants were asked if they had PsO or PsA and if it was physician diagnosed: those diagnosed by a physician were invited to participate in the full survey. Final survey data were weighted to match national sex and age distributions. Self-perceived disease severity was expressed by a 5-level score. Severity of PsO based on the % body surface area (BSA, mild ≤ 3%; moderate 4–9%; and severe </P>

<P>skin (1 palm = 1% BSA). Results: Among 22,050 individuals questioned, reported prevalence of PsO and/or PsA was 9.7% (9.4% in Sweden, 9.2% in Denmark, and 11.9% in Norway); 1264 (5.7%) individuals reported physician diagnosis and 1221 of these completed the full survey. Among survey participants, 74.6% reported PsO alone, 10.3% PsA alone, and 15.1% both. There was a limited correlation between self-perceived disease severity and estimates of % BSA for PsO (Spearman’s rho 0.42). Self-perceived PsO severity was related </P>

<P>Introduction: Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated disease that negatively affects the quality of life of patients.1 Despite recent advancements in treatment, patient expectations may differ from the treatment outcome, potentially leading to dissatisfaction. Objective:To evaluate patient expectations on psoriasis treatment outcomes and to what extent these were met by the treatment. Methods: Data were collected from patients with moderate-toseverepsoriasiswith≥3%skininvolvement.Patientswereincluded from 17 European countries and Canada through a structured, web-based interview in their local language. Patients were on topical, PUVA/phototherapy, conventional systemic or biological treatment. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted. Results: Overall, 1946 patients (mean [SD] age: 42 [13] years, 43% male) with psoriasis were surveyed between 6 July 2016 and 5 May 2017. The vast majority of patients currently on treatment </P>

<P>Introduction: Psoriatic comorbidities have been shown to be inversely associated with socioeconomic position (SEP). We hypothesized that the social patterning of paediatric psoriasis would be similar to that observed for several psoriatic comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Objectives: Our aim was to investigate whether maternal SEP is a determinant of paediatric psoriasis. Methods: Data on paediatric psoriasis from 36,003 offspring of a national birth cohort were cross-linked with nation-wide registry data on maternal educational attainment, maternal labour market attachment and equivalised household income. We performed logistic regression analyses to test for associations between measures of maternal SEP and paediatric psoriasis. Cohort analyses were </P>

<P>conducted, estimating the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence </P>

<P>intervals (CI) of offspring psoriasis. We included maternal age at birth and maternal psoriasis as covariates in adjusted analyses. Results: Maternal educational attainment and equivalised household income were inversely associated with offspring psoriasis. Offspring of mothers with a low educational attainment had an OR </P>

<P>1.62 (95% CI: 1.20–2.18; p&lt; 0.01) of paediatric psoriasis, after adjusting for maternal psoriasis and age, compared to offspring of mothers with a medium educational attainment.

<P>0.59 (95% CI: 0.44–0.80; p&lt; 0.001) of paediatric psoriasis, after adjusting for maternal psoriasis and age. Conclusion: Lifetime prevalence of paediatric psoriasis was inversely associated with maternal SEP in our study population. Early </P>

<P>Introduction: Psoriasis is a T-helper-1 and -17 cell-mediated, </P>

<P>chronic,inflammatoryskindiseaseaffectingapproximately1–3% </P>

<P>of the general population. Psoriasis is currently considered as a </P>

<P>chronic low-grade inflammatory condition that plays an active </P>

<P>role in the development of the pathophysiologic phenomena responsible for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Obesity, as a component of the metabolic syndrome, represents a major comorbidity and possibly contributes to reduced treatment response. Objective:This nationwide, population-based study investigated the impact of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) on the psoriasis in the Korean population. Methods: We used the health check-up database, which is subdataset of the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Study population includes subjects who had undergone health screenings between January 2009 and December 2012. Patients who were diagnosed with psoriasis prior to the health screening or who were less than 20 years of age were excluded. This study investigated newly diagnosed patients with psoriasis (ICD-10 code, L40) by dermatologists among subjects during the follow-up period through the claim data. Result: Total 22,633,536 subjects were included and psoriasis newly developed in 399,461 subjects. Mean BMI among newly developed psoriasis group (23.9±3.25) was higher than non-psoriasis group (23.68±3.27)(p&lt; 0.0001). Mean WC of newly developed psoriasis group (81.21±9.27) was higher than non-psoriasis group (79.99±9.26) (p&lt; 0.0001). BMI showed J-shaped association with the risk of psoriasis. Subjects with BMI over 30 had higher risk of psoriasis (HR 1.118, 95% CI 1.1–1.137). The risk of psoriasis increased in proportion to WC. Subjects with WC over 105 cm showed highest risk of psoriasis (HR 1.305, 95% CI 1.261–1.349) after adjusting confounding factors including BMI. The risk of psoriasis increased most in the male group with normal weight, abdominal obesity (HR 1.175, 95% CI 1.15–1.2). Conclusion: According to our study, the WC is more likely to affect the risk of psoriasis than obesity. Our study supports the association between abdominal obesity and psoriasis, which increases awareness of the role of abdominal obesity in the pathogenesis and comorbidities of psoriasis. </P>

<P>CLINICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS IN A MULTIDISCIPLINARY CARE MODEL OF PATIENTS WITH PSORIASIS </P>

<P>Dalila Alejandra Lopez-Rodriguez Dermatologico Country Introduction: Psoriaticarthritis(PsA)isan inflammatory arthropathy that occurs in patients with Psoriasis (PsO). The frequency of PsA in patients with PsO has been estimated between 10–40%. The presentation and clinical course are variable, therefore, it is necessary to understand the clinical behavior, severity and associated factors that condition functional impairment, disability and lost quality of life. Objective:To describe the clinical features of the ApS, in a multidisciplinary PsO clinic. Methods: Prospective study, August 2016-february 2018, patients attending to Multidisciplinary Clinic for psoriasis in Dermatologico Country were included. Results: Atotalof53participantswereincluded,findingaprevalence of psoriatic arthropathy of 58.5%. The median age was 42 years and 71% were female. Patients with ApS have higher frequency of DM2, metabolic syndrome and hepatic steatosis. However, the differences are not statistically </P>

<P>significant,whichcouldbearesultofthesamplesize.According </P>

<P>to the activity of PsO the most frequent presentation was plaque psoriasis in 67.7%. Median PASI was 5.4 (1.5, 16.4). Axial presentation of ApS was observed in 51.6% and peripheral disease in 71%, enthesitis was found in 54.8% and dactylitis 16.1%. To determine the severity of PsA according DAS 28 score, we found 45.2% of patients presented severe activity. One hundred percent of the subjects with peripheral disease did not achieve low activity criteria of the disease measured by MDA. When calculating the tertiles of the HAQ instrument, it is possible to observe that 51.6% of patients presented severe deterioration in the quality of life. In the logistic regression model without adjustment, the presence of a severe DAS 28 is associated with an increase in the risk of deterioration in quality of life, with OR of 6.24 (1.74, 22.2). The presence of BMI &gt; 27 is associated with an increase in the risk of deterioration in quality of life with OR of 6.53 (1.59, 26.8). When performing the adjusted multivariate model, the only variables that were associated with severe deterioration of quality of life were the presence of BMI &gt; 27 and on the other side, pain, with BMI &gt; 27 is the factor that mostly impairs the quality of life. Conclusions: Prevalence of PsA in this series of patients with skin or nail psoriasis was 58.3%. The 45.2% of patients showed severe activity and 51.6% severe deterioration in their quality of life, that leads to disability and limitation performing daily activities. An early diagnosis provides the possibility of appropriate treatment to improve function, quality of life and decrease the progression and complications of the disease. </P>

<P>QUALITY OF CARE FOR PSORIASIS IN THE PAST 12 YEARS – RESULTS FROM A SERIES OF NATIONWIDE HEALTH CARE STUDIES IN GERMANY </P>

<P>Matthias Augustin Institute for Health Services Research in Dermatology Introduction: In Germany, the quality of health care for psoriasis </P>

<P>was very critical in 2005. Most patients lacked of sufficient care </P>

<P>and there was only a minor proportion receiving systemic drugs. In the mean time, there has been conducted a national psoriasis program in order to improve the quality of psoriasis care, including development of an evidence-based guideline, a consensus of treatment goals, the invention of a “culture of measurement” and consented national goals for psoriasis care. These measures were supported by the establishment of 30 regional psoriasis networks involving more than 800 dermatologists. Objectives: (1) Presentation of the very recent results on the health care situation of patients with psoriasis vulgaris in dermatological treatment in Germany 2016/17 (2) Comparison of health care quality indicators between the surveys 2004/05, 2007, 2013/14 and 2016/17. Methods: Nationwide, non-interventional, cross-sectional studies. In each survey between 71 and 130 centers included patients and data from patients and dermatologists were obtained from a minimum of 1500 patients per survey. Quality of care indicators were severity of the psoriasis (PASI and proportion of patients with PASI &gt; 20, indicating high severity), quality of life (DLQI and proportion of patients with DLQI &gt; 10, indicating strong impairments in quality of life), previous systemic therapy and </P>

<P>inpatienttreatmentinthe lastfiveyears. </P>

<P>Results: Between January 2016 and December 2017 n= 1827 patients from 93 dermatological centers were included in the recent survey (mean age 51 years, 45.2% female). 7.5% had severe psoriasis (PASI &gt; 20) compared to 9.2% in 2013/14, 11.6% in 2007 and 17.8% in 2004/05. The mean PASI was 7.3 compared to 8.1 in 2013/14, 10.1 in 2007 and 11.4 in 2005. The mean DLQI was 6.1 compared to 5.9 in 2013/14, 7.5 in 2007 and 8.6 in 2005. 21.4% reported a strongly impaired quality of life (DLQI &gt; 10) compared to 21.3% in 2013/14, 28.2% in 2007 and 34.0% in 2005. 59.5% of all participants stated that they had received systemic therapy at </P>

<P>Introduction: Psoriasis is a common, chronic and non-communicable skin disease with an immensely negative impact on </P>

<P>people’s lives. There is a lack of standardized case-definition or </P>

<P>methodology leading to a wide variation in the prevalence estimate </P>

<P>between0.09%and11.43%.Totacklethisknowledgedeficitand </P>

<P>in response to the WHO Global report on Psoriasis (2016), the </P>

<P>Global Psoriasis Atlas (GPA) will be a first-ever online leading </P>

<P>epidemiological database on psoriasis. It will inform research, policy and health care provision worldwide. GPA provides a detailed disease prevalence and incidence as well as information on access to treatment, comorbidities and cost to society which will enable extensive comparisons between countries over time. Furthermore, it will provide accurate health data for decision makers, stakeholders and patients worldwide. Objectives: The GPA includes two Work Streams (WS) Teams. WS1 is conducting extensive literature review on psoriasis. In this paper the WS2 is explaining the development of methodology to serve the framework for compiling the GPA data. Methods: Currently, data sources are being collected in two phases and for the selection of data sources an in-/exclusion criteria were developed and followed. Firstly, a global online survey on data sourceidentificationisbeingconductedin &gt; 150 countries worldwide addressed to dermatologists and non-dermatologists. The </P>

<P>questionnaire identifies local, regional and national data sources </P>

<P>including registries, research institutes, projects, publications and other relevant sources supporting the GPA project. Secondly, Desk research on the same data sources is being conducted. Discussion </P>

<P>search in Dermatology and Nursing (IVDP) </P>

<P>Introduction: Skin diseases account for one of the most common human illnesses globally but in the recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, psoriasis, for example, ranked 144 out of 174 conditions in the DALY rankings. Two components of DALY calculation are prevalence of the disease and disability weight factor. The derivation of disability weight (DW) factor depends on many factors which can lead to wide range of results. GBD methodology </P>

<P>cansignificantlyunderestimatethe skin diseaseburden. </P>

<P>Objective:To understand the currently used DWs of skin diseases in-depth and if these current records of DWs can be solely based on a survey that was conducted on the general population. Methodology: A systematic literature review was performed to answer the research questions. Comprehensive search of eligible </P>

<P>scientificandgreypublicationinEnglish,from2007to2017,were </P>

<P>conducted in PubMed and EMBASE (Ovid). The studies included were based on 16 skin condition and other diseases indicating a re-estimation, alternative approach (also besides DALY) to DWs. 20 relevant studies were included and have been elaborated in the review based on a ‘conceptual model of assessing DWs and its design choices’ by Haagsma et al., 2014. The health state descriptions, panel composition, and valuation methods used to derive DWs in these studies is discussed in detail. Results: There was scarce literature available for skin diseases in particular. DW value depends on and can vary with the panel composition: general public, health experts or patients. The health </P>

<P>state description whether disease specific or generic, with or </P>

<P>without label, describing the course of condition over a period or </P>

<P>only temporarily, can all influence the panel members’decision. </P>

<P>The valuation methods paired comparison, population health equivalence, visual analogue scale, standard gambling or person/ time trade-off can alter the results to a great extent. The contextual differences across the countries can also make a difference in the calculation. The inclusion of certain skin conditions/health states under other medical specialties can be a major factor leading to underestimation of overall skin disease burden worldwide. </P>

<P>Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland Introduction: Polymorphism within the miR-499 has been reported to be associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in various populations. Objectives: Ourstudyaimedtofindoutwhethersimilarassociation could be observed also in Polish population in both RA and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients. Methods: For this purpose 359 individuals were studied, including 111 RA patients, 86 patients with PsA and 162 healthy blood donors that served as a control group. Genotyping for miR-499 rs3746444 T/C was performed using a LightSNiP assay. Results: Distribution of the miRNA-499 alleles and genotypes was similar in RA patients and controls. Among RA patients those carrying the CC homozygous genotype presented with lower DAS28 at diagnosis (0.027) but higher CRP levels after 12 weeks of anti-TNF treatment (p= 0.042). Interestingly, the TT genotype (rs3746444) was overexpressed in patients with PsA as compared to controls (OR = 1.85, p= 0.034) but its frequency </P>

<P>wasnotsignificantlydifferentwhencomparedtoRAcases.This </P>

<P>polymorphism was also not found to be associated with clinical parameters in PsA patients. Conclusions: These results show that miR-499 rs3746444 T/C polymorphism may constitute a risk factor for psoriatic arthritis development. </P>

<P>in genes related to the inflammasome has been discovered. So far, no studies investigating genetic polymorphisms in inflammasome genes in patients with Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) have been published. Aim: To analyse different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP:s) in genes related to the inflammasome in relation to different disease phenotypes of Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA). Methods: DNA from 771 PsA patients from Northern Sweden were analyzed for different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NLRP3 ( rs35829419 (NLRP3-Q750K), rs10733113, rs4353135), CARD8 (CARD8-C10X, rs 2043211) and NLRP1 (rs8079034, rs878329) in relation to different phenotypes of PsA. Results: AsignificantassociationwasseenwithNLRP1 rs878329C and patients with axial involvement of disease. When different genotypes were compared, significantly higher frequency of genotype CC were detected in the subgroup with axial involvement of disease. In addition, NLRP1 rs8079034T was significantly associated with prescription of a csDMARD. Also, the NLRP3 rs10733113 showed association with the G-allele in patients with a skin disease with an early onset (Pso type1, onset &lt; 40 years) and in the subgroup of PsA with destructive-/deforming disease </P>

<P>Introduction: Studies describing the occurrence of inadequate response (IR) to biologic treatments in psoriasis (PSO) in the realworld setting are currently lacking. Thus an understanding of IR, due to the lack of treatment durability, persistence, or access, to 1st line biologics in PSO may help to identify and address unmet treatment needs. Objectives: To assess the frequency of IR in the year after initiation </P>

<P>of1stlinebiologictreatmentforPSO.IRwasdefinedasbiologic </P>

<P>dose increase, biologic discontinuation, or add-on treatment. Methods: Retrospective analysis of commercial US healthcare claims (2012–2016) was conducted. Patients initiating a biologic (PSO approved anti-TNF, secukinumab, ustekinumab, apremilast) </P>

<P>with ≥ 1 year of database enrolment before and after biologic </P>

<P>initiation (index date) who had a qualifying PSO ICD 9/10 code and no previous biologic exposure in the year prior to the index date were included. Patients experiencing any of the following </P>

<P>were classified as experiencing an IR event: 1) ≥ 1 claim with a biologic dose &gt; 110% of the label-recommended dose for ≥30 days, 2) cessation of 1st line biologic ( &gt; 2 months with no tre</P>

<P>atment) (‘non-switch discontinuation’), 3) cessation of first line </P>

<P>biologic followed by initiation of a new biologic within 2 months, or 4) addition of a corticosteroid, immunosuppressant, or biologic (‘add-on treatment’) with any days’ supply overlap. Results: Of the 13,995 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 9,520 (68.0%) experienced an IR event in the 12-month follow-up period (53.2% female; mean age: 46.2 yrs) and 4,475 (32.0%) did not experience an IR event (45.2% female; mean age: 46.9 yrs). The most frequently used 1st line biologics were adalimumab (42.5%) and etanercept (26.5%); the proportion of IR patients was 60.4% in adalimumab and 75.8% in etanercept. Among all IR patients, </P>

<P>non-switch discontinuation was experienced by 63.8% of patients, switch to another biologic by 15.1%, above label dosing by 11.5%, and add-on treatment by 9.7%. Overall, the mean time from initiation of 1st line treatment to IR event was 4.7 months, ranging from </P>

<P>4.3months to add-on therapy and 5.7 months for patients switching to another biologic. Among patients switching to another biologic, 70.3% of patients were persistent on the new biologic after three months versus 54.0% after 6 months. The most frequent add-on therapies were immunosuppressive drugs (63.8%) followed by systemic corticosteroids (20.6%), and biologics (15.5%). Conclusions: IR in 1st line PSO biologic treatment is common with non-switch discontinuation being the most frequent. This highlights an opportunity to optimize treatment options currently available and better understand patients’ needs for successful therapy. Therapeutic options with improved durability may provide a clinically meaningful path to optimizing psoriasis management. Further analysis is necessary to identify underlying causes of IR and to guide more effective approaches to treatment. Acknowledgements: This study was supported by UCB Pharma. </P>

<P>BARRIERS OF GUIDELINECOMPLIANT CARE FOR PSORIASIS IN GERMANY – RESULTS OF THE EUROPEAN STUDY PSOBARRIER </P>

<P>Matthias Augustin, Anna Langenbruch, Marc Radtke, Nicole Zander </P>

<P>University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf Introduction &amp; Objectives: A series of nation-wide studies in Germany over the last years has focused on the quality of psoriasis </P>

<P>care.Itwasfoundthatasignificantproportionofpsoriasispatients </P>

<P>is not treated according to the national guideline1. Similar under</P>

<P>provision of care has been identified in other countries as well, reflectedbypatients’dissatisfactionwiththemanagementoftheir </P>

<P>disease2. This study aims to identify these barriers of guidelinecompliant healthcare for psoriasis in Europe. Materials &amp; Methods: The study assesses barriers and quality of health care in a multi-centre, cross-sectional study design. Par</P>

<P>ticipating centres in five European countries (Denmark, Poland, </P>

<P>Spain, United Kingdom, and Germany) aim to represent the range of dermatological health care-providing outpatient facilities of the respective country. The current analysis includes the data collected in Germany from January 2016 to May 2017. Results: Data of n= 497 patients were analysed. Mean age was 49.7 years, 41.4% were female. Mean PASI was 7.2 ± 9.2, 20.9% had a PASI &gt; 10. The mean DLQI was 6.2 ± 6.7. 27.0% were currently treated with systemics (excluding biologics), 22.3% with biologics. Since the diagnosis of psoriasis, the participants consulted on average 3.0 ± 2.3 different dermatologists (min 0/max 27) and had 3.5 ± 3.7 therapy changes. For 32.0% of the patients the time </P>

<P>betweenthefirstskinchangesandthefirstdiagnosisofpsoriasis </P>

<P>was one year or longer. 7.6% stated that their health insurance turned down a therapy, treatment or referral that was recommended by a physician at least once. Conclusions: The quite high numbers of consultations of different dermatologists, therapy changes and therapies turned down indicate that there might be barriers in psoriasis care. The generated data facilitate measures for an improved patient access to systemic drugs and biologics. The European comparison will allow for </P>

<P>the first time the direct description of psoriasis care in a wide </P>

<P>variety of European countries. The matching of patient-reported outcomes with data of the health care system and barriers from the physician’s perspective is a novelty worldwide and the results will contribute to developing strategies to overcome these barriers. </P>

<P>Introduction: Psoriasis and its complications are still a challenge to clinicians. The autoimmune disorder though targeting the skin, involvestheimmunesystemasawhole.Theinflammatorycomponent in the pathogenesis of psoriasis has further established the role of aberrant immune system in the process [1, 2, 3]. Homeopathy addresses every individual’s peculiar combination of genetic and epigenetic causative factors in the development of such auto immune diseases [4, 5]. Therefore it may be considered as a therapy where integrated approach is indicated. Case series: 5 cases of psoriasis are presented, two of which were in erythrodermic state [one also with sepsis superimposed]. Through monitoring of blood markers and documenting on photos and videos the effect of individualised homeopathic therapy on psoriasis and its complications is demonstrated. The theory of Levels of Health can explain the variety in the presentation of psoriasis and response to treatment in terms of the time taken and number of remedies required. The same theory also helps to assess the prognosis and comprehend the response to treatment [LOH]. With the help of the evidence of these cases we may formulate a larger study to ascertain the extent to which classical homeopathy may be employed in psoriasis. Conclusions: These cases depict the potential for homeopathy in alleviating the suffering of patients with psoriasis if applied as individualised therapy and give grounds to further conduct control</P>

<P>A UNIQUE CLINICAL CASE OF PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS AND RELAPSING POLYCHONDRITIS </P>

<P>Elena Gubar, Alla Godzenko, Tatiana Korotaeva </P>

<P>Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology, Moscow Introduction: Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare systemic autoimmune disorder affecting the cartilaginous structures of the body and resulting in their destruction. In the literature available we didn’t findanyreferencesto RPoccurring togetherwith psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Objective:to demonstrate a rare clinical case of RP and PsA. Methods: Patient (pt) (female), 29 y.o., complained of pain, swelling, and hyperemia of both ears, pain in the joints, in heels and toes and pain in cervical spine. Scalp psoriasis (Ps) and Ps in the external ear canal occurred in April, 2017, nail Ps and dactilitis in October, 2017; in November, asymmetrical polyarthritis, pain in heels, pain and limitation of movement in cervical spine developed. Besides the pt noticed redness, swelling and pain in pinnas of both ears and impairment of hearing; conjunctivitis, stomatitis and subfebrile temperature developed. </P>

<P>At presentation: plaque Ps on the face and scalp, nail Ps, palmoplantar feet pustulosis (BSA–4%, PASI –2.1); both pinnas of the ears were swollen, painful and red; ear lobes were not involved. The pt suffered from conjunctivitis. The pt had asymmetrical polyarthritis, dactylitis, achillobursitis. Painful movements at cervical spine, rotation 30°-35°. ESR 54 mm/h, CRP 99 mg/l, RF negative, positive HLA B27, HLA B5 not detected. PET-CT imaging did not reveal any pathological changes besides bilateral </P>

<P>auricularinflammation. </P>

<P>Results: PsA diagnosis was determined according to CASPAR criteria. RP diagnosis was based on the McAdams criteria. The </P>

<P>diagnosis is definite when no less than three out of six criteria </P>

<P>are present: bilateral auricular chondritis, nonerosive serone</P>

<P>gative arthritis, nasal septum chondritis, ocular inflammation, </P>

<P>respiratory tract chondritis, and cochlear disorder. Our pt had bilateral auricular chondritis, conjunctivitis, cochlear disorder. The diagnosis was confirmed by ear-auricles biopsy which showedperichondrialinflammationandgranulocyteinfiltration.The </P>

<P>therapy delivered: methotrexate s/c 10 mg pw; Solu-Medrol i/v (750 mg cumulatively); methylprednisolone per os 16 mg per day. Within days, there was normalization of temperature, ear-auricle swelling, redness and pain had regressed; hearing was restored, conjunctivitis passed, the intensity of arthritises, dactylitis and spondylitis had decreased; the reduction in ESR, CRP was to 14 mm/h, to 7.0 mg/l accordingly. Conclusion: As is known, when a pt has PsO, he is twice as likely to develop additional autoimmune diseases. It is of great importance to properly diagnose and treat cross autoimmune diseases.

<P>SPINY FOLLICULAR HYPERKERATOSIS IN A PSORIASIS PATIENT TREATED WITH USTEKINUMAB </P>

<P>Antoanela Carija, Adela Markota Cagalj, Neira Puizina Ivic </P>

<P>University Hospital Centre Split Introduction: We present a psoriasis patient developing asymptomatic white spiny follicular hyperkeratoses (SFH) after being treated with ustekinumab for 3 months. Objectives: This type of eruption has been described under several names including spiny follicular keratoderma, hyperkeratotic spi</P>

<P>cules,filiformhyperkeratoses,parakeratotichorns,andfollicular </P>

<P>hyperkeratoses (1). Facial hyperkeratotic spicule eruption was reported in association with monoclonal gammopathy. Drug-induced </P>

<P>filiformhyperkeratosishasbeenreportedwithcyclosporine,with </P>

<P>BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib), with acitretin and with vismodegib and sorafenib. Methods: Our patient started ustekinumab treatment in June 2015. At the same time he was treated with metothrexate, folic acid, metformin and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide. Three months after ustekinumab introduction patient noticed growth of tiny skin projections located on the face, scalp, upper trunk and upper arms. Each spiny lesion was approximately 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter and up to 5 mm high. A biopsy of a white spiny keratotic projection showed orthokeratosis, achantosis and mild spongiosis in epidermis, </P>

<P>inflammatoryinfiltratein choriumanddilatated acrotrichiums. </P>

<P>Condition resolved in several weeks without any treatment and without ustekinumab cessation. Results: A similar condition viral-associated trichodysplasia (TS) was originally described in 1999 as a folliculocentric viral infection in a patient who was receiving cyclosporine after kidney and pancreas transplantation. Trichodysplasia spinulosa associated </P>

<P>polyomavirus (TSPyV) was identified in TS lesions and shown </P>

<P>to be the probable cause of this disease (2). Pathogenesis both of viral-associated TS and BRAF inhibitor-induced SFH is based on the paradoxical activation of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway, which regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell division, differentiation and apoptosis. Conclusions: Our patient developed SFH possibly due to use of ustekinumab, IL-12 and IL-23 inhibitor. The latter has a role in differentiation process of the skin (12), suggesting that inhibition of IL-23 might explain the imperfect keratinization process observed in SFH. Considering that in our patient drug was not stopped and the condition resolved in several weeks without any treatment, possible cause could be ustekinumab-induced immunosupression and consequent viral infection. </P>

<P>COMBINATION THERAPY OF APREMILAST AND BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT IN A PATIENT WITH PSORIASIS </P>

<P>Apremilast was approved in March 2017 in Japan for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Apremilast appears to </P>

<P>have lower efficacy than biological product. However, its ease </P>

<P>of administration as an oral agent coupled with a mild side ef</P>

<P>fect profile makes it an attractive option for psoriasis treatment. </P>

<P>While monotherapy with biological products is effective for </P>

<P>many patients with psoriasis, some patients are not satisfied by </P>

<P>the outcome. There are few data or reports about the safety and </P>

<P>treatment of psoriasis. We report a 46-year-old man with about a twenty-year history of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis who failed several therapies including topical therapy, phototherapy and etretinate. At the time of presentation, the patient was using secukinumab for 9 months, which had controlled his arthritis. However, the patient noted plaque remained mainly on his lower legs. Apremilast was added and up-titrated to 30 mg twice per day along with his secukinumab therapy. After two months of combination therapy, the patient’s disease has improved and stabilized with only a few scattered erythematous mildly scaly plaques on his lower legs. The patient denied side effects of nausea, diarrhea or headache. Laboratorywork was within normal limits. However, we also experienced two other cases who failed apre</P>

<P>suggest that if a patient experience a severe allergic reaction to the originator drug it is most possible the same reaction to happen with the biosimilar this may not always be the case. Methods/Results: We present a case of a 60 years old female patient </P>

<P>with itching and facial redness which was treated successfully with antihistamines without the need of interrupting the infusion. Patient was also administered pretreatment therapy with a three day course of corticosteroids to minimize these reactions. During the last infusion patient presented severe body rash and hypotension which led to the discontinuation of the infusion. Due to the great therapeutic response and because patient had undergone several therapies in the past which either hadn’t tolerated or hadn’t responded to, she was reluctant to change therapy so we decided to switch to a biosimilar. Patient is currently through the eight month of treatment with the biosimilar with no sign of reaction and with maintenance of the therapeutic response.

<P>Introduction: The treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis in an everyday clinical setting, sometimes, poses serious challenges. The presence of hepatitis B Virus Infection (HBV) in these patients complicates the therapeutic choices. Objectives: We report the case of a female patient, 52 years old, suffering from moderate-to- severe plaque psoriasis and chronic hepatitis B. Methods: She was referred to our outpatient psoriasis clinic with a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 13.2. The patient’s condition has deteriorated the past year but she had not received any kind of systemic treatment. During our pre-treatment screening tests she was found HBsAg positive although the liver function tests were within normal rates. The HBV serological status of the patient (HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs and anti-HBe) was estimated. HBV DNA load was measured with the </P>

<P>Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method, in order to confirm </P>

<P>that the disease was not active, and it was undetectable. Results: At that point it was decided to treat the patient with Apremilast using the standard titration dosing schedule (10mg on day one and increasing the dose by 10 mg daily) until reaching the maintenance dose of 30mg twice daily on day 6. Antiviral treatment was not given to the patient but liver function tests were performed at a monthly basis and HBV load every three months during treatment. All these test from the baseline until last observation (12 months after) were within normal rates. The patient exhibited an amelioration of her condition from the beginning </P>

<P>whichwasconfirmedbythesignificantreductionofherPASIscore </P>

<P>which reached PSI75 at week 12 and PASI90 at week 24. At the time of this writing, one year after the initiation of treatment, the patient remains almost clear from her psoriatic lesions. Apremilast was well-tolerated by the patient. Conclusions: The treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis in the background of chronic HBV limits the therapeutic options due to the possibility of HBV reactivation when the psoriasis patient is treated with immunosuppressive or even immunomodulatory drugs. Apremilast is an oral small-molecule PDE-inhibitor, approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderate-to-severe- plaque psoriasis in 2014. It does not target </P>

<P>IL22 INDUCES KERATINOCYTES HYPERPROLIFERATION IN PSORIASIS VIA MIR21 AND MIR31 UPREGULATION </P>

<P>Florence Abdallah Centre de Biophysique Moléculaire, CNRS UPR4301, Orléans, France </P>

<P>Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects </P>

<P>people of all ages with an estimated 3% prevalence worldwide. It manifests as thick red irritated skin lesions due to imbalanced keratinocytes hyperproliferation and differentiation caused mainly by increased activation of IL-22 pathway in keratinocytes. Emer</P>

<P>ging studies showed a specific psoriatic miRs signature where </P>

<P>miR-21 and miR-31 are one of the most upregulated miRs. The </P>

<P>latters act by favoring cellular proliferation and inflammation. </P>

<P>Hence, re-conciliating the microRNAs and the immunopathogenic occasions responsible for psoriasis development can be a new approach for developing effective mechanism and target-based agents to treat psoriasis. The common hyper-proliferation effect of IL-22, miR-21 and miR-31 prompted us to look after a potential interaction between these actors. The expression levels of those 2 microRNAs and that of their targets were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo studies in presence or absence of IL-22. </P>

These observations indicate the implication of miR-21 and miR-31 in proliferationdifferentiation processes in the different layers of the epidermis. We also examined the miR-21 target RE PTEN involved in cell growth and apoptosis control and the miR-31 target RE ppp6c involved in G1 to S phase transition restriction. In line with the upregulation of miR-21 and miR-31, IL-22 stimulation resulted </P>

<P>SERUM CONCENTRACION OF IFNGAMMA IN PATIENTS WITH PSORIASIS: CORRELATION WITH CLINICAL TYPE AND SEVERITY OF DISEASE </P>

<P>Nermina Ovčina-Kurtović, Emina Kasumagić-Halilović, Jasmina Muhović </P>

<P>Dermatovenerology Department Clinical center University of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina Introduction: Psoriasis is a multifactorial chronic inflammatory </P>

<P>disease. The etiopathogenesis of the disease is still unclear but there is evidence that many of cytokines released by keratinocytes </P>

<P>and inflammatory leukocytes may contribute to the induction or persistence oftheinflammatory process inpsoriasis. </P>

<P>Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate serum concentrations of INF-gamma in patients with psoriasis and the healthy subjects and also to assess a possible association between IFNgamma, clinical type and severity of disease. Methods: The study included a total of 60 patients with psoriasis, both genders and all of ages. There were 20 healthy subjects in the control group. According to the clinical type of disease, patients with psoriasis were divided into four groups: psoriasis vulgaris, psoriasis pustulosa, psoriasis erythrodermica and psoriasis arthropatica. Blood samples were collected from all psoriasis patients and from healthy control subjects. Serum IFN-gamma levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. The severity of psoriasis vulgaris was assessed by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. Results: Of the total number of patients suffering from psoriasis 42 (70%) had psoriasis vulgaris. The second most frequent was psoriasis erythrodermica 9 (15%), while 6 (10%) patients had psoriasis pustulosa and 3 (5%) psoriasis arthropatica. The serum concentartion of IFN-gamma in patients with psoriasis was sig</P>

<P>nificialy higher than that in the control group (1.91+1.79 pg/ml vs 0.91+0.38 pg/ml, respectively). Significantly elevated serum </P>

<P>IFN-gamma concentrations were noticed in patients with psoriasis vulgaris (2.15+0.30 pg/ml), compared with patients suffering from psoriasis erythrodermica (1.57+0.68 pg/ml), psoriasis arthropatica (1.33+0.53 pg/ml), and in particular patients suffering from psoriasis pustulosa (1.08+0.21 pg/ml) who had the lowest mean serum concentration of IFN-gamma. There was no statistically </P>

<P>significant difference between the mean values of IFN-gamma </P>

<P>compared to the clinical type of psoriasis (p&gt;0.05). In the group of patients with psoriasis vulgaris 36 (85.71%) patients had mild form of disease with PASI &lt; 50, and 6 (14.29%) patients had severe disease with PASI &gt; 50.

<P>IMMUNOLOGICAL MEMORY EXISTS IN THE RECURRENT LESION AND NONRECURRENT SKIN AFTER REMISSION IN PSORIATIC PATIENTS </P>

<P>Zhu Shen Institute of Dermatology and Venereology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences &amp; Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital </P>

<P>Introduction: Psoriasis usually recurs in previously affected areas, so a pathogenic memory has been proposed, but the nature of such </P>

<P>site-specificrecurrent memory is not completely known.Tissue</P>

<P>resident memory T (TRM) cells are non-recirculating memory T cells that persist long-term in epithelial tissues, including the skin. Because they can localize in the skin for many months, we speculate that TRM may contribute to recurrent pathology of psoriasis. Objectives: The aim of the present study is to compare the differences of quantity proportion and secretion ability of cytokines of the TRM cells between recurrent and nonrecurrent lesions following remission, as well as to explicit the possible survival signal for these TRM cells in psoriatic lesion. Methods: RNA-Seq, Gene Ontology and KEGG analysis, real-time </P>

<P>PCR,flowcytometeranalysis/sorting,cellstimulationassay,and </P>

<P>western blot were used to explore the immunological memory. Results: Compared with normal skin, there are common shared genessignificantlyupregulated(&gt; 2 folds, p&lt; 0.001) by recurrent and nonrecurrent lesions, including CD69. CD69 mRNA transcription level in nonrecurrent lesions after remission remains as high as in neighboring recurrent lesions. CD8+CD69+ TRM cells exist in both lesions, and they can secret almost same amount of IL-17A and IL-22 after stimulation. Levels of IL-15, secreted by keratinocytes in psoriasis epidermis, in nonrecurrent lesions remain as high as in neighboring recurrent lesions, and recombinant human IL-15 can induce CD69 on TRM cells. Conclusions: Our preliminary study shows that CD8+CD69+ TRM cells persist in clinically resolved psoriatic lesions whether it recurs or not, and they can produce IL-17A and IL-22 with critical effect on psoriatic recurrence and development. Furthermore, we have indicated the IL-15 may play crucial role in the survival of CD8+CD69+ TRM cells in psoriatic lesions. </P>

<P>have a SPP morphology and demonstrate increased expression of LL37 by keratinocytes, activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells and upregulated type-1 interferons (IFN). These lesions express fewer epidermal CD8 T cells. Objectives: Our aim is to characterize the immune-phenotype of SPP in multiple clinical scenarios. We hypothesize that SPP develops as a result of increased expression of cytokines and antimicrobial peptides involved in the type-1 IFN pathway. Methods: Skin biopsies were obtained from three patients with TNFi-induced psoriasis, three patients with SLE and psoriasis, three patients with positive ANA and psoriasis, two patients with ICI-induced psoriasis and two patients with chronic plaque psoriasis as control. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against type-1 IFN induced MXA, LL37, IL-36 and CD8 T cells. The intensity and the area of positively stained samples were </P>

<P>eachgradedfrom0–4andthenmultipliedtoprovideafinalscore. </P>

<P>Results: Small plaque lesions in various clinical scenarios had histologic changes consistent with psoriasis.. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed an increased expression of MXA (TNFi = 14, SLE = 13.3, ANA = 11.3, ICI = 16 vs. control = 6, t-test p&lt; 0.05), LL37 (TNFi = 10.8, SLE = 6, ANA = 9.7, ICI = 12 vs. control = 2, t-test p&lt; 0.05) and IL-36 (TNFi = 10.5, SLE = 13.3, ANA = 11, ICI = 7, control = 0.25, t-test p&lt; 0.05) in the keratinocytes of SPP patients. There was decreased CD8 T cell migration to the epidermis in SPP compared to control. Conclusion: This is the first study to describe the immunephenotype of SPP and to extend the phenotype observed in TNFi induced psoriasis to varying clinical scenarios. There was an increased expression of MXA, LL-37 and IL-36 as well as fewer epidermal CD8 T cells than in chronic plaque psoriasis consistent with the type-1 IFN pathway of psoriasis pathogenesis. This immune-phenotypic analysis may suggest tailored therapy for this form of psoriasis. </P>

<P>DIFFERENTIAL NH2TERMINAL AUTOANTIGEN TRIMMING MAY EXPLAIN EPISTASIS BETWEEN HLAC*06:02 AND ERAP1 VARIANTS IN PSORIASIS RISK </P>

<P>Introduction: NH2-terminal trimming by endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) generates the appropriate length of antigenic peptides for binding to and presentation by HLA-class I molecules. Genetic interaction between ERAP1 variants and HLA-class I alleles determines the genetic risk for various HLA</P>

<P>C*06:02 and ERAP1 variants affects also psoriasis risk but the mechanisms of these gene interactions remained unknown. Using </P>

<P>presentationandwehadidentifiedapeptidefromADAMTS-like </P>

<P>protein 5 (ADAMTSL5) as HLA-C*06:02-presented melanocyte autoantigen. Objectives: To determine the role of ERAP1 variants in psoriasis pathogenesis. Methods: We established ERAP1 knockout cells using CRISPR/ Cas9 system. ERAP1 knockout cells transfected with plasmids coding for HLA-C*06:02, ERAP1 variants, and antigenic peptides were co-cultured with the TCR hybridoma to determine </P>

<P>the levels of TCR ligation which reflect the generation of the antigenic ADAMTSL5 peptide and other Vα3S1/Vβ13S1-TCR </P>

<P>ligands from precursors. Results: Our data show that NH2-terminal trimming by ERPA1 is required to generate the actual antigenic ADAMTSL5 peptide from NH2-terminally elongated precursors. An ERAP1 variant protecting from psoriasis reduced the immunogenicity of the antigenic ADAMTSL5 peptide presumably through overtrimming and peptide destruction, whereas a psoriasis risk variant of ERAP1 highly kept the antigenicity of the autoantigen. This effect was </P>

<P>specific for ADAMTSL5. Precursors of other Vα3S1/Vβ13S1</P>

<P>TCR self-ligands were not substrates of ERAP1. Conclusions: Using a proven psoriatic autoantigen and a cognate psoriatic TCR, these experiments provide direct evidence that gene-gene interaction between ERAP1 and HLA-C*06:02 affects the risk for psoriasis through differential autoantigen trimming from precursors. These data furthermore propose a model where ERAP1 function essentially controls the autoantigenic potential of self-peptides in HLA-class I associated CD8+ T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases. </P>

<P>Objectives: To examine the potential role of environmental factors in the psoriatic autoimmune response. </P>

<P>Methods: We first determined the particular amino acid motif which is recognized by the psoriatic Vα3S1/Vβ13S1 TCR in </P>

<P>the context of HLA-C*06:02. By homology searches using this conserved amino acid pattern, we selected 57 peptides from food, bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens and from the skin and intestinal microbiomes as candidate environmental antigens that may trigger the psoriatic autoimmune response. We cloned the peptides into expression plasmids, co-transfected them with HLA</P>

<P>C*06:02 into Cos7 cells and used them to stimulate theVα3S1/ Vβ13S1 TCR. TCR ligation was determined by GFP induction </P>

<P>Introduction: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) arises in an increased burden of psoriasis and impairments in both quality of life and functional capacity. The relationship between nail involvement and PsA in psoriasis is not fully characterized. Objective:To evaluate the frequency and characteristics of nail involvement in psoriatic patients and to assess the relationship with joint involvement. Methods: A total of 197 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, were consecutively selected to participate in this cross-sectional study. The patients divided into two groups; with and without psoriatic arthritis. Results: 69.5% of psoriatic (137 out of 197) patients had nail involvement. The most common nail abnormality was onycholysis, followed by pitting and oil drop. Nail changes were more common in patients with psoriatic arthritis (82.1% vs. 57.8%). Limitations: Our study had certain limitations. One of them was lack of information about the subtypes of PsA. Also, we have not recorded the severity of nail involvements. Furthermore, previous medications may have interfered with the degree of nail changes in our patients. Conclusion: Nail involvement is associated with PsA. Onycho</P>

<P>lysis, splinter hemorrhage, and oil drop were significantly more </P>

<P>common in PsA group. In general, psoriatic patients with arthritis had the more severe disease. </P>

<P>Introduction and Objectives: Ixekizumab (IXE), an interleukin17Aantagonist, has shown superior efficacy in psoriasis compared to placebo,1 etanercept,1 and ustekinumab.2 This post hoc analysis intended to evaluate absolute and relative Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvements with IXE treatment in a phase 3 trial (IXORAP). Methods: In IXORA-P, patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis were randomized (2:1:1) to receive any of the 3 dosing regimens of IXE 80 mg: every 2 weeks (Q2W; n= 611), every 4 weeks (Q4W; n= 310), or Q4W/Q2W step-up (n= 306), for 52 weeks. Randomizationwasstratifiedbycountryandweight(&lt; 80kg,≥80 to &lt; 100kg,or≥100kg).Thepercentageofpatientsachievinga 75%, 90% or 100% improvement from baseline in PASI (PASI 75, 90, and 100) was evaluated using logistic regression with dosing regimen, country, and baseline weight as factors. Fisher’s exact test with nonresponder imputation was used to compare the response rates between treatment groups. Here, we present results at 12 weeks for Q2W (label dose) and Q4W groups; results from Q4W/Q2W group will be discussed separately. Results: Mean (standard deviation) PASI score at baseline was </P>

<P>20.3 (8.25). Response rates were significantly higher (p&lt; 0.001) for Q2W group compared to Q4W group across all cut-off points for absolute PASI: absolute PASI ≤1, 2, 3, and 5 response rates at Week 12 were 61.4%, 76.1%, 84.5%, and 89.4%, respectively, for Q2W group, and 49.7%, 64.5%, 72.6%, and 83.9%, respectively, for Q4W group. At Week 12, PASI 75 response rates in Q2W and Q4W groups were 89.2% and 83.2%, respectively (p= 0.012). For Q2W and Q4W groups, PASI 90 response rates were 75.3% and 63.2%, respectively (p&lt; 0.001), and PASI 100 response rates were 46.0% and 32.6%, respectively (p&lt; 0.001). Conclusion: As reported in psoriasis registration trials, induction with IXE Q2W, the labeled dosing regimen, provides better clinical outcomes at Week 12. </P>

<P>Objective:to compare skin lesion severity of two early peripheral PsA patient populations – with and without axial involvement. Methods: 95 patients (pts) (M/F–47 /48) with early PsA according to CASPAR criteria were included; all pts had peripheral arthritis for ≤ 2years;noinflammatorybackpain(IBP)ptswerespecially selected. Mean age 36.5±10.7 yrs, disease duration 12.2±10.3 mo, disease activity indexes DAS = 4.0±1.4, DAS28 = 4.2± 1.1, BASDAI = 4.5±1.6. Skin lesion severity was evaluated in terms of body surface area (BSA) affected and Psoriasis Area Severity </P>

<P>Index (PASI). When BSAwas ≥3%, PASI was calculated. PASI ≥11 indicates moderateandsevere psoriasis. Allptswereevaluatedforthepresenceofinflammatorybackpain </P>

<P>(IBP) by ASAS criteria. IBP was observed in 63 (66.3%) cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of SIJs was performed in 79 pts, regardless of the presence of IBP, on Signa Ovation 0,35T. MRI results were evaluated by an independent reader. Bone marrow edema on MRI (STIR) was considered as active MRI sacroiliitis (MRI-SI). MRI-SI was detected in 28 of 79 (35.4%) examined cases. The examination also included X-ray of sacroiliac joints (SIJs) (pelvic radiographs). Radiographic sacroiliitis (R-SI) was </P>

<P>split into two groups: those with axial involvement (axPsA), that is with IBP and/or MRI-SI and/or R-SI; and those without axial involvement (having only peripheral PsA [pPsA]). The axPsA group included 65 (68.4%) cases, the pPsA one 30 (31.6%) cases. Results: skin lesions’ severity was higher in the axPsA group than in the pPsA group: in axPsA pts BSA median was 3.0 [1.0 – 9.0] and in pPsA pts it was 1.0 [0.2 – 3.0] (р= 0.007); in the axPsA group PASI median was 15.6 [6.6 – 55.2] and in the pPsA group it was6.0[0.0 – 7.2](р= 0.006).

<P>Introduction and Objectives: Psoriasis is a condition typically requiring long-term treatment, thus longitudinal data establishing the safety of approved therapies are required. We report exposure adjusted incidence rates (IRs per 100 patient years) for treatmentemergent adverse events (AEs) per year of treatment from a pooled analysis of all secukinumab psoriasis trials to date (19 studies, </P>

<P>4,674 patients, 10,061 patient-years exposure; secukinumab exposure up to 5 years). Methods: AE IRs were examined per year for subjects receiving secukinumab, and for 52 weeks only for those receiving etanercept (ETN), ustekinumab (UST), or placebo (PBO). Results: Duration of exposure through 52 weeks of secukinumab treatment 300 mg, ETN 50 mg, UST 45/90 mg, and PBO was 1467.4, 296.9, 318.1, and 301 patient-years, respectively.

<P>Introduction: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic immune</P>

<P>mediated inflammatory disease affecting peripheral and axial </P>

<P>joints. For patients with active psoriasis, the added burden of skin disease can further reduce health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with joint disease. Objective:To determine the contribution of joint and skin improvements in HRQoL of patients with active PsA during Phase 3 clinical trials investigating ixekizumab (IXE) treatment. Methods: The double-blind Phase 3 trials (SPIRIT) investigated thetreatmentof IXE,a high-affinitymonoclonalantibodyselectively targeting interleukin-17A, for patients with active PsA. The integrated database of 2 SPIRIT trials consisted of biologic </P>

<P>disease-modifying antirheumaticdrug (DMARD)-naïve patients </P>

<P>(SPIRIT-P1, NCT01695239) or inadequate responders to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitors (SPIRIT-P2, NCT02349295). Patients were randomized to 80mg IXE every 4 weeks (Q4W, n= 229) or 2 weeks (Q2W, n= 226) after a 160mg starting dose or placebo (PBO, n= 224). At baseline and Week 24, joint and skin diseases were measured by the Disease Activity index for PSoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA; calculated post-hoc) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), respectively. HRQoL was measured by EuroQoL 5 Dimensions Visual Analog Scale (EQ-5D VAS), Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), and Work Productivity </P>

<P>and Activity Impairment-Specific Health Problem (WPAI). The </P>

<P>synergistic contribution of skin and joint improvements to HRQoL was modeled using smoothing spline method and depicted with response surface. Missing data were imputed using last observation carried forward. Results: Of 679 PBO- and IXE-treated patients in the SPIRIT </P>

<P>trials, 402 (65%) and 224 (36%) patients had ≥3% body surface area(BSA)and≥10%BSApsoriasisatbaseline,respectively. In </P>

<P>these patients, we applied response surface modeling to investigate the relationship among DAPSA, PASI, and change from baseline in EQ-5D VAS at Week 24. The greatest improvement in EQ-5D VAS was associated with the largest percent improvements in both DAPSA and PASI together, rather than DAPSA or PASI alone.Similarobservations,regardlessof≥3%or≥10%BSAbaseline psoriasis, were made in domains of SF-36 (General Health, Physical Functioning, Social Functioning, and Vitality; data not shown) and WPAI (Activity Impairment; data not shown). Conclusion: For PsA patients with psoriasis, optimal improvements in patients’ HRQoL, as measured by select domains of patient-reported outcomes, were dependent on successful treatment of both joint and skin symptoms.

<P>Introduction: Palmoplantar psoriasis (ppPsO) occurs in up to 40% of plaque psoriasis subjects and is often resistant to treatment. It is associated with pain, functional limitations, and greater impairment of health related quality of life compared with plaque psoriasis on other parts of the body (1). Secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody which selectively neutralises IL-17A, has </P>

<P>shown long lasting efficacy and safety in the complete spectrum </P>

<P>of psoriasis manifestations, including nails, scalp, palms and soles and psoriatic arthritis. </P>

<P>safety and efficacy of secukinumab 150 and 300 mg s.c. in 205 </P>

<P>subjects with moderate to severe ppPsO. Results: As previously reported, after 16 weeks placebo-controlled treatment, the primary endpoint palmoplantar Investigator’s Global Assessment (ppIGA) 0/1 and all secondary endpoints of this study were met, demonstrating superiority of secukinumab to placebo at week 16 (2). An interim analysis at week 80 established the continuation improvement of palmoplantar disease for all efficacy parameters. The effect was sustained through 2.5 years with 59.2% and 52.5% of subjects in secukinumab 300 and 150 mg groups, respectively [multiple imputation (MI)] achieving clear or almost clear palms and soles (ppIGA 0/1). Consistent with this observation, the mean palmoplantar Psoriasis Area and Severity Index % change from baseline reached –74.7% and –61.6% for secukinumab 300 and 150 mg, respectively, at 2.5 years (MI). The Dermatology Life Quality Index 0/1 response, was achieved in 45.5% vs. 23.9% of subjects for secukinumab 300 and 150 mg groups respectively (LOCF). Pain and function of palms and </P>

<P>which can be associated with the obesity. A link between body mass index (BMI) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) has been found recently. But there is limited data about this association in Russian population and from real-world data. Objective:To study the incidence of PsA in PsO patients (pts) with/without obesity. Methods: 103 pts (male-47/female-56) with different forms of plaque PsO, mean age 44±13.69 years (yrs.), mean PsO duration 10.7±10.2 yrs., mean PASI 15.39±12.51 were included. 61 out of 103 pts with PsO (59.2%) had psoriatic arthritis (PsA) by CASPAR criteria.

Objectives: To describe and compare the baseline demographic, </P>

<P>disease, and clinical characteristics – specifically, the history of </P>

<P>a PsA diagnosis among PsO pts treated with SEC vs other Tx. Methods: Approximately 2,500 adult pts (1:1 ratio, SEC: other Tx) will be recruited. A decision regarding treatment must have been reached prior to enrollment. The independent-samples and Chisquare tests were used for continuous and categorical variables, respectively, for treatment group comparison. Results: As of Nov 27, 2017, 1032 pts (397 SEC vs 635 other Tx) had been enrolled. Mean age (50.5 vs 49.4 years), time since diagnosis (18.5 vs 16.9 years), duration since symptom onset (20.5 vs 19 years), and race (78.6% vs 83.8% Caucasian) were comparable between groups. The percentage of females was lower in the SEC group (38.0%) vs other Tx (45.5%; p= 0.037). At baseline, the majority of SEC-treated pts (66.2%) were employed, and 23.7% vs 34.8% vs 34.3% had public vs private vs combined coverage, respectively. There was no difference between cohorts. A higher proportion of SEC pts had a history of PsA (23.2% vs 15.0%; p= 0.001) or diabetes (18.1% vs 13.4%; p= 0.072) compared to pts on other Tx.

Results: This analysis included 575 (TIL 100 mg) and 581 (TIL 200 mg) patients; the proportions of patients with week-28 PASI 75/90/100 responses were 77%/54%/23% (TIL 100 mg) and 78%/58%/29% (TIL 200 mg). At week 28, 133 (23.1%), 175 (30.4%), 137 (23.8%), 82 (14.3%), and 48 (8.3%) TIL 100 mg patients and 170 (29.3%), 169 (29.1%), 114 (19.6%), 105 (18.1%), and 23 (4.0%) TIL 200mg achieved PASI 100, PASI 90–99, PASI 75–89, PASI 50–74, and PASI &lt; 50, respectively. On average, PASI 100 patients were younger, lighter, and had shorter disease duration at baseline compared to other response groups. For TIL 100 mg, % PASI improvement was highest for PASI 100 and least for PASI &lt; 50 patients on all visits up to week 28 (week 4: 53%, 46%, 38%, 30%, and 16%; week 28: 100%, 95%, 83%, 64%, and 33% for PASI 100, PASI 90–99, PASI 75–89, PASI 50–74, and PASI &lt; 50 categories, respectively). Among patients achieving PASI &gt; 50 at week 28 and continued up to 52 weeks, % PASI improvement maintained or improved from week 28 to week 52. Similar results were observed for TIL 200 mg as well as a subgroup analysis with bio-naive and bio-experienced patients respectively. Conclusions: The majority of TIL 100 and 200 mg patients achieved PASI &gt; 50 response at week 28, and PASI improvement was maintained from week 28 to week 52. Among patients achieving PASI &gt; 90 at week 28, TIL 100 and 200 mg were associated with a rapid PASI improvement by week 4. </P>

<P>POTENTIAL DISCONNECT: COMANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS BETWEEN RHEUMATOLOGISTS AND DERMATOLOGISTS </P>

<P>Lynn Price, Jennifer Robinson, Gianna Melendez </P>

<P>Spherix Global Insights Introduction: On average, the majority of psoriasis (PSO) patients are diagnosed a year prior to a psoriatic arthritis (PsA) diagnosis, making the referral patterns and co-management between derma</P>

<P>tologists and rheumatologists an important aspect to understanding the management of these diseases. Dermatologists represent an important referral-base for rheumatologists, accounting for over one-quarter of all new PsA patients. However, there are discrepancies between the specialists regarding the timing in which these referrals take place. Objectives: One objective of the study was to gain further insight into rheumatologist and dermatologist co-management of patients with PsA. </P>

<P>Methods: Anindependentmarketanalyticsfirmcollaboratedwith US rheumatologists (n= 101) and US dermatologists (n= 101) to conduct analysis of both the PsA and PSO markets. Data were </P>

<P>collected via an online survey fielded in November/December </P>

<P>2017 and included patient demographics, as well as physician demographics, and attitudinal survey responses. Results: Rheumatologists indicate that 51 percent of referrals result from primary care physicians, 28 percent result from a dermatologist, and 13 percent are self-referred. The majority (73%) of PsA patients under the care of collaborating rheumatologists had previously been diagnosed with PSO prior to PsA. Dermatologists state that one-quarter of their patients with severe PSO also have PsA, with more than one-third of severe PSO patients also being co-managed with a rheumatologist. The majority of rheumatolo</P>

<P>gists believe that dermatologists refer patients at the first sign of </P>

<P>joint involvement and do not attempt to treat joint pain; however, 31 percent of dermatologists report they do not refer PSO patients to rheumatologists until patients have failed biologics or are not improving on their current systemic regimen, while an additional 35 percent report they refer only severe arthritis/patients with worsening disease. Furthermore, only 35 percent of dermatologists agree that they refer their PSO patients to a rheumatologists at the </P>

<P>firstsignofjointinvolvement. </P>

<P>At the time of dermatologist referral, rheumatologists state that </P>

<P>two-thirdsofreferredpatientsarebiologic/apremilastnaïve,with </P>

<P>only 6 percent having controlled PSO and joint pain. However, dermatologists state that 40 percent the patients that they referred to rheumatologists were treated with biologics and 15 percent of said referred patients were treated with apremilast. Indeed, 76 percent of dermatologists agree with the statement, “I believe that starting my PSO patients earlier on biologic therapy will slow the development and progression of the arthritic component of the disease (PsA),” while 57 percent of dermatologists agree “I prefer to use biologics that are indicated in both PSO and PsA.” Conclusion: With many patients diagnosed with both PSO and PsA, co-management between dermatologists and rheumatologists is common. While rheumatologists appear to be under the impression that they are receiving the majority of dermatologist</P>

<P>treated patients with PsA at the first sign of joint involvement, </P>

<P>dermatologists largely report that they are managing and treating PsA patients. Furthermore, most dermatologists believe early aggressive use of biologic treatments will mitigate the development and/or progression of joint involvement, implying their willingness to manage their patients with PsA, particularly at early stages. </P>

<P>THE USE OF TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR INHIBITORS (TNF) IN THE SECONDLINE BIOLOGIC/SMALL MOLECULE SETTING: A CROSSSPECIALTY COMPARISON </P>

<P>Lynn Price, Jennifer Robinson, Gianna Melendez Spherix Global Insights </P>

<P>TNF therapy has been the standard of care for adult patients diagnosed with autoimmune conditions, resulting in familiarity, comfort, and satisfaction among physicians. TNFs are typically </P>

<P>used as a first-line biologic/small molecule in the treatment of </P>

<P>psoriasis (PSO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). However, the adoption of agents with alternate mechanisms of action (AMOA) has increased in recent years across indications and the practice of sequential TNF prescribing after an initial TNF is less common. ThoughTNFsarestillthepreferredfirst-lineagent,therearediscrepancies between specialists on the use of AMOA agents in the second-line setting. This research sought to understand the extent to which AMOA agents are prescribed after an initial TNF, and how this varies across PSO and PsA. Anindependent market analyticsfirm collaboratedwith US dermatologists (n= 201) and US rheumatologists (n= 200) to conduct a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with PSO (n= 950) and PsA (n= 1,008) who had switched from one biologic/ apremilast to another agent in the prior 12 weeks. Physicians were able to submit up to 7 patient charts. PSO data was collected in September 2017 and PsA data was collected in April 2017.

<P>Introduction/Objective:VOYAGE 2 is a phase 3 double-blind, placebo/active comparator-controlled trial comparing guselkumab (GUS) with placebo (PBO) and adalimumab (ADA) in patients (pts) with moderate-to-severe PsO. The impact of treatment on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) was evaluated. Methods: Pts were randomized to GUS 100mg (wks 0 &amp; 4, then q8wks), ADA (80 mg wk 0, 40 mg wk 1, then 40 mg q2 wks), or PBO (wks 0, 4, &amp; 12, then GUS 100 mg wks 16 &amp; 20). We evaluated PROs using the Work Limitations Questionnaire [WLQ; work productivity], the Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale [HADS], and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36; health related quality of life) at wk16 (GUS vs PBO) and wk24 (GUS vs ADA) in pts with and without PsA. Results: In all, 18% of pts reported a history of PsA. At wk16, GUS pts had numerically greater improvements vs PBO in work productivity, anxiety and depression, and SF-36 PCS &amp; MCS scores regardless of PsA status. The least square (LS) mean differences (95% CI; adjusted for baseline value) for GUS vs PBO for all PROs were generally similar between pts with and without PsA. At wk24, GUS pts had numerically greater improvements vs ADA in all PROs regardless of PsA status. The LS mean differences for GUS vs ADA were generally greater for pts with PsA vs pts without PsA (Table). Conclusions: GUS showed better improvements in all PROs vs PBO at wk16 and vs ADA at wk24. Improvements vs PBO were similar regardless of PsA status, while improvements vs ADA were greater for pts with PsA.

<P>Introduction: The most severe form of psoriasis is psoriatic arthritis (PsA), which belongs to the seronegative spondyloarthritis group, characterizedbychronicinflammationofthejoints,spine,enthesis. The frequency of PsA in the population is 0.06–1.4%. PSA is comparable to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in terms of progression, disability and quality of life (QOL) in patients. Objectives: Compare the quality of life index of patients with severe forms of psoriasis (PsO) with psoriatic arthritis patients’ index. Methods: 120 (100%) patients suffering from PsO and PsA (Male-87/female - 33) were analyzed. 70 (54.2%) patients were diagnosed PsO, 50 (41.7%) were diagnosed PsA. The average age of patients with skin manifestations PsO was 54.0±14.2 years (n= 70). The average age of patients with PsA was 49.1±15.9 years (n= 50). The group of patients with PsA was older than the group PsO patients by age. PASI &gt; 10. The quality of life was assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire. The results were evaluated: from 0 to 1 score - cutaneous disease does not affect the patient's life, from 2 to 5 scores - the disease has a minor effect on the patient's life, from 6 to 10 scores - the disease has a moderate effect on the patient's life, from 11 to 20 scores - the disease has a very strong effect on the patient's life, from 21 to 30 scores - the disease has an extremely strong effect on the patient's life. Statistical processing of the data was carried out using the Excel analysis package. All p&lt; 0.05 were considered </P>

<P>to indicate statistical significance. </P>

<P>Results: 120 (100%) patients suffering from PsO were taken for analysis. The duration of PsO was: for more than 15 years - 25 people (35.7%), 10–15 years - 18 people (25.7%); 3–10 years -15 people (21.4%), 1–3 years - 12 people (17.1%). The duration of PsA was: for more than 15 years – 5 people (10.0%), 10–15 years – 7 people (14.0%); 3–10 years – 20 people (40.0%), 1–3 years – 18 people (36.0%). Heredity was aggravated in 35 (29.1%) out of 120 patients. Comorbidity was presented in 112 (93.3%) out of 120 patients. Gastrointestinal and liver diseases were found in 48 (42.8%) out of 120 patients. Type 2 diabetes was observed in 45 (40.1%) out of 120 patients, cardiovascular diseases -in 100 (89.2%) out of 120 patients, diseases of the nervous system - in 59 (52.6%) out of 120 patients, and diseases of the urinary system - in 20 (17.8%) out of 120 patients. The total score DLQI in the psoriasis group was 15.8±5.2. The score DLQI in PsO patients was 12.5±3.4 and in PsA patients was 20.4±3.7. The total score DLQI in PsO patients with comorbidity was 16.1±5.3. </P>

<P>Conclusions: The total score DLQI was significantly higher in </P>

<P>patients with PsA compare to PsO patients. This result revealed the existence of an inferior quality of life for the PsO patients with comorbidity disease, compared with pts without comorbidity disease. The score of DLQI is affected the development and progress of the psoriasis and comorbidity pathology. Then higher DLQI value, the more it affects experience considerable physical and/ </P>

<P>EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESSBASED COGNITIVE THERAPY ON SELFREPORTED PSORIASIS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS </P>

<P>Alan Maddock, David Hevey </P>

<P>School of Psychology, Trinity College Dublin Introduction: Psoriasis can have a profound impact on a patient’s life, with the prevalence of anxiety, depression, poor wellbeing and quality of life generally found to be high in psoriasis populations. Mindfulness based interventions have been shown to have positive impacts on anxiety, depression, wellbeing and quality of life in various populations. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on psoriasis symptoms and psychological symptoms associated with psoriasis including anxiety, depression, reduced wellbeing and QoL. The </P>

<P>mechanisms the ‘Clinically Modified Buddhist Psychological </P>

<P>Model (CBPM)’, these variables being acceptance, mindfulness, self-compassion, aversion, non-attachment, attention, rumination and worry. </P>

<P>Methods: 101 participants were randomly allocated to a treatment arm (MBCT) or a TAU arm. Participants were measured pre, posttreatment and after a 3-month follow up period. Data were analysed using intention-to-treat analysis and the ANCOVA method with baseline scores entered as covariates.

<P>School of Psychology, Trinity College Dublin Introduction: Psoriasis is a common condition with recognised psychological comorbidity. Psoriasis can have a profound impact on a patient’s life, with the prevalence of anxiety, depression, poor wellbeing and quality of life generally found to be high in psoriasis populations. Based on Buddhist psychology, mindfulness based interventions have been shown to have positive impacts on anxiety, depression, wellbeing and quality of life in various populations. Methods: Mixed methods explored the impact of a mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention on 10 psoriasis patients using a Buddhist Psychological Model (BPM) as a theoretical framework to understand changes in these variables. Quantitative measures of acceptance, attention regulation, attachment, aversion, self-compassion, mindfulness, rumination, worry, wellbeing, anxiety, depression and psoriasis symptoms were completed pre and post intervention, and participants were interviewed about their experiences of MBCT. </P>

<P>Results: Statisticallysignificantchangesinattention,mindfulness, </P>

<P>attachment, aversion, rumination, quality of life, anxiety and psoriasis were found. The qualitative data provided support for the BPM as a theoretical lens with which to understand the way in which mindfulness impacts on patient quality of life, anxiety and psoriasis symptoms. Conclusions: This study gives support to the promising potential of mindfulness interventions being implemented by mental health care professionals with psoriasis patients. </P>

<P>Objectives: To evaluate psoriatic arthritis (PsA) symptoms, life impact and treatment satisfaction in pts who report good communication with their HCP vs suboptimal communication. Methods: An online pt-based survey was conducted in the US from 2 Nov–1 Dec 2017. Pts had reported having PsA for &gt; 1 </P>

<P>year, taken ≥1 synthetic(s) or biologic(b) DMARD for PsA. Pts </P>

<P>reported overall health, PsA severity/symptoms/life impact, treatment satisfaction and communication experience. We evaluated differences by pt-HCP communication status. Results: Overall, 301 pts with PsA responded, mean age 45 years, 61% female, 89% self-reported moderate/severe PsA. Current PsA treatments included bDMARD (52%), sDMARD (25%), combination b/sDMARD (15%). Overall, 256 (85%) of PsA pts were managed by a rheumatologist and 15% by a dermatologist. Of the 256, &gt; 40% reported suboptimal pt-HCP communication. Pts in the suboptimal vs good communication subgroups were typically younger, more likely to be Hispanic and reported greater life impact and lower satisfaction with pt-HCP communication (Table). </P>

<P>Introduction: Psoriasis is a skin disease that can occur at any time and it is most common in the age group 50–69. The reported prevalence of Psoriasis in countries ranges between 0.09% and 11.4%, making it a serious global problem. Psoriasis affects the quality of life and it is associated with many comorbidities such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and psoriatic arthritis. </P>

<P>Toevaluatetheseverityandtheefficiencyofthetreatmentapplied </P>

<P>to patients with Psoriasis, in practice it is used PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index). The value may vary, for example, in this study, PASI 75 represents the percentage (or number) of patients that have achieved a 75% or more reduction in their PASI score in 12 weeks from baseline. Objectives: Aim of this study is to gain a better perspective on the Psoriasis patient’s point of view when seeking a physician’s help, therefore, to try and minimize the gaps that exist when managing them. Methods: This study was based on a custom questionnaire which included 14 questions for each patient. The responses were gathered from 20 patients (and it is still ongoing) diagnosed in our Department of Dermatology and Venereology Timisoara, each </P>

<P>in different stages of disease. All the answers are confidential </P>

<P>and anonymous. An informed consent was signed prior to any taken actions. To achieve meaningful results, we asked patients to be honest and to present the situation in a real way. The most important question on the questionnaire was “Which of the three options represents the PASI score you would like to achieve? 50/75/90?”. In addition to this question, we provided the patients with three pictures each of them showing a different PASI score, so they can choose the proper answer much easier. Results: 80% of the patients chose PASI 90, 15% chose PASI 75 and only 5% chose PASI 50. In addition to this, the gender distribution showed us that 100% of the female patients chose PASI 90, proving how important appearance is for them, and how much of a weight it is for them to have disease that is in the limelight. On the other hand, the male patients were divided into three groups. 69% said that the </P>

<P>efficiency of the therapy is very good, choosing PASI 90. Only </P>

<P>23% of male patients consider PASI 75 satisfying and the last 8% represents PASI 50. </P>

<P>Conclusions: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease, which </P>

<P>is intensively studied at the cellular and molecular level. What is considered a good response to a treatment is sometimes different from the perception of a patient vs. a physician, therefore we must always keep a balance between aiming high (and maybe risking to over-treat some patients) and meeting the patient’s expectations. </P>

<P>Introduction: Patients’ perspectives on the effects of psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are important in establishing better approaches to their care and treatment. Objectives: To better understand the impact of PsO and PsA on daily life, education and work in Scandinavian countries. Methods: The NORdic PAtient survey of PsOriasis and Psoriatic arthritis (NORPAPP) was an on-line survey carried out in Nov/ Dec 2015 using YouGov panels in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. Adults (18–74 years old), with physician-diagnosed PsO or PsA (n= 1221), answered questions about the impact of disease on 10 aspects of daily activity/mood and on work/education; 5-point Likert scale responses were dichotomised into “no/minor impact” (1–3 or “don’t know”) and “strong impact” (4–5). Results: For the 10 aspects of activity/mood a “strong impact” was </P>

The most commonly reported strong impacts were limitations on dress (22.6%), sleep disorders (16.3%) and depression and/or anxiety (16.2%) for respondents with PsO alone; and, daily routine (45.1%), leisure/sports (44.0%), sleeping disorders (44.5%), and limitations on clothing (41.8%) for respondents with PsA±PsO. Regarding the impacts on work/career or education since development of symptoms, 6.4% of respondents with PsO alone and 30.3% of those with PsA±PsO reported a strong negative impact. Of the 82.2% of respondents who were working or studying, frequency of absences in the previous 12 months </P>

<P>QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH PSORIASIS IN KHARTOUM DERMATOLOGY HOSPITAL, DECEMBER 2017 </P>

<P>Hind Madani </P>

<P>University of Khartoum- faculty of medicine Introduction: Psoriasis is a common chronic non-contagious skin disease, affecting 1–3% of the world population. Defects in the </P>

<P>immune regulation and the control of inflammation are thought </P>

<P>to play major roles. Quality of life (QOL) is increasingly recognized as an important outcome measure in dermatology. Psoriasis although it doesn’t affect the survival it has a great impact on quality of life of patients, and has a strong effect on social relations, psychological status, daily activities and thought to be associated with depression. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of psoriasis on the quality of life(QOL) of the patients in Khartoum dermatology hospital, 2017. Methods: Descriptive case series study, hospital based survey conducted among 70 participants from psoriasis patients aged above 18 years in Khartoum dermatology hospital, through selfadministered standard questionnaire, which was developed after extensive literature reviewing, comprised of Socio-demographic data, psoriasis life stress inventory(PLSI), psoriasis disability index(PDI) and depression assessment. Results: 64.3% of the participants have a high psoriasis-related stress (PLSI) and 35.7% have a low psoriasis-related stress. 21.4% of the participants have a very large disability in daily activities (PDI), 37.1% have a large disability, 24.3% have a moderate disability, 14.3% have a mild disability and 2.9% have no disability at all.7.1% of the participants have a moderately severe depression, 15.7% have a moderate depression, 35.7% have a mild depression, 41.4% have none or minimal depression and none of the participants has a severe depression. Conclusion: the study concluded that psoriasis has impacts on the quality of life, causing high stress and high disability in daily activities with variable degrees of depression. Key words: psoriasis, QOL, PLSI, PDI, depression. References: </P>

<P>Objective:This analysis examined the effect of treatment with tildrakizumab (TIL) on personal relationships of patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Methods: Patients in two phase 3 trials reSURFACE 1 (NCT01722331) and reSURFACE 2 (NCT01729754) were randomized to subcutaneous TIL 200 mg, 100 mg, or placebo (PBO) and received treatment at weeks 0 and 4. PBO patients were re-randomized at week 12 to either TIL 200 mg or 100 mg. Etanercept (ETN) 50 mg (semiweekly until week 12 then weekly until week 28) was also a treatment arm in reSURFACE 2. Data on personal relationships were collected at weeks 12 and 28 from the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire question 8 (Q8) “Over the last week, how much has your skin created problems with your partner or any of your close friends or relatives” and question 9 (Q9) “Over the last week, how much has your skin </P>

<P>caused any sexual difficulties”. Each question was scored on a </P>

<P>scale of 0 (not affected at all) to 3 (very much affected). The data were pooled from reSURFACE 1 and 2. Results: In all, 1,820 patients had DLQI data. All patients reported a negative effect for Q8 and Q9 at baseline. At week 12, the proportion of patients with no negative effect (score of 0) on personal relationships (Q8 and Q9) was higher for TIL 200 mg, TIL 100 mg, and ETN than for PBO (76%, 72%, and 64% vs. 39%, respectively). A similar trend was observed for individual questions Q8 and Q9. At week 28, more patients on TIL 200 mg and TIL 100 mg reported no negative effect on personal relationships than those on ETN (85% and 77% vs. 66%; respectively). More patients on TIL 200 mg and TIL 100 mg reported no negative effect than those on ETN for Q8 (89% and 81% vs. 70%; respectively) and for Q9 (89% and 84% vs. 75%, respectively). </P>

<P>Introduction: Chronic pruritus lasts for at least 6 weeks and is a most common symptom in patients with psoriasis. Pruritus is a highly prevalent and troublesome symptom and has a negative impact upon patients’ health-related quality of life (QoL). The ItchyQoLisapruritus-specificQoLquestionnairethatcanbeapplied to patients with pruritus independent of the underlying disease. Objective:To assess the impact of pruritus on QoL in patients with psoriasis by an exploratory analysis of baseline characteristics of subjects from the PSORITUS study. Methods: PSORITUS was an exploratory, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled 16-week drug withdrawal study with a 16-week open-label run-in phase, to assess the kinetics of psoriasis symptoms, pruritus intensity, and lesional biomarkers.

A multiple linear regression model was performed to assess the effect of exploratory variables correlating with the ItchyQoL score and achievingstatisticalsignificance (p-value &lt; 0.05). Results: The study included 130 subjects with psoriasis. The subjects had a mean age of 46.8 years (standard deviation [SD], </P>

<P>Conclusions: ItchyQoL assessment demonstrated that subjects with psoriasis are highly burdened by pruritus and show severely impaired quality of life.

<P>Introduction: Psoriasis is a common, long-term skin disease that affects approximately 1.5–3% of the population. The burden of living with psoriasis is equivalent to or greater than that seen in other long-term conditions, such as cardiac failure and chronic lung disease. The stigma provoked by the disease, often lead to the discontinuation of daily activities and social withdrawal. Nevertheless, these effects of psoriasis are seldom recognized and often undertreated. Objectives: The aim of the study is to evaluate the quality of life, anxiety and depression, self-esteem and loneliness in patients with psoriasis. Methods: Ninety-eight patients with psoriasis were enrolled in the study. The quality of life, depression and anxiety, loneliness and self-esteem of the patient were assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the UCLA loneliness Scale (UCLA-Version 3) and Rosenberg’s Selfesteem Scale, respectively. Results: The Dermatology Quality of Life Index score among psoriasis patients was 13.52±4.58.Theyhadstatisticallysignificantly higher scores according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale -anxiety subscale (p= 0.031)-compared with healthy volun</P>

<P>Introduction: A global patient survey was adapted and implemented in Sweden, in order to explore and understand the patients’ view on their disease, as well as the personal and emotional impact of their psoriasis. The focus of the survey was the patient’s perception of the possibility to achieve clear skin, and how having clear skin could affect their quality of life. A publication based on earlier data is under review. Methods: The Swedish “Clear about Psoriasis” survey was conducted from June 16 2017 to August 8 2017. Recruitment was made via online panels and patient organizations. Validated methods were used to assess severity of disease and health-related quality of life. The survey consisted of multiple-choice questions, no definition of clearskin wasgiven, and spontaneousfeelings/perceptionswerereported.Respondents(≥18yearsold)wererequired </P>

<P>to have current plaque psoriasis, for which they had received a medical diagnosis and should not have participated in an online survey about psoriasis in the preceding four weeks. The analysis included only patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, </P>

<P>defined as a PsoriasisArea Severity Index (PASI) score ≥10, or </P>

<P>a PASI score 5.0–9.9 with plaques in visible and/or in sensitive areas, such as the face and genitals. Results: In total, 54 patient responses were completed and analyzed. Mean age was 45 years and 80% were female. The average self-assessed PASI score was 16.0, 26% had PASI 5.0–9.9, 74% PASI &gt; 10 and 54% reported to have psoriatic arthritis. Current treatment allowed 44% of patients to achieve clear or almost clear skin. Clear or almost clear skin was believed to be achievable by 30% of the patients. Of patients reaching clear or almost clear skin, 71% had talked to their physician about their aim for clear skin. Among patients who have not achieved clear or almost clear skin, 47% had spoken to their physician about their aim. 57% of </P>

<P>the patients were satisfied with their current treatment. The most </P>

<P>important reasons for treatment satisfaction were less itching (81%), and the achievement of less pain and soreness (55%). Not achieving clear skin was the major reason for dissatisfaction. Discrimination or humiliation has been experienced by 98%. About 69% have been asked if they are contagious. Relationships were affected and 52% avoided to have sex. Worklife was affected by 65% of the respondents. For 58% of patients it took more than 5 years to get a treatment that resulted in clear or almost clear skin. During the last 6 months, 24% of employed patients had taken at least one day off work due to their disease whilst 5% took more than 14 days. Conclusions: This survey shows that a majority of patients do not believe achieving clear or almost clear skin is possible and they are not comfortable to talk to their physician about it. Furthermore, patients encounter a stigmatizing environment. Better treatment as well as improved patient information is needed. Novartis is grateful to Psoriasisförbundet for facilitating the survey. </P>

<P>Introduction: Coach@home (c@h) is a German support program for certolizumab pegol (CZP)-treated patients (pts) with rheumatic diseases, including psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Eight coaching calls are offered over one year, scheduled around critical milestones on the therapeutic journey. These are made by trained nurses, who offer support and information about both the pt’s disease and its treatment with CZP. </P>

<P>Objectives: To assess the baseline characteristics of PsA pts subscribed to c@h, and the level of pt satisfaction with the program across indications (Sep 2017 data cut). Methods: c@h was launched in Jun 2014, and is available to pts who are prescribed CZP according to the local product label. Pts </P>

<P>mustbeCZP-naïvewhensubscribedtotheprogram,andptconsent </P>

<P>is required prior to subscription by the treating physician. There are no additional criteria for enrolment, although the program must be recommended to the pt by the treating physician. Pt satisfaction across indications (PsA, rheumatoid arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis) was measured at program completion or discontinuation using the net promoter score (NPS), which has previously been used for this purpose.1 The NPS is derived by asking pts to state the likelihood that they would recommend c@h to others (on a 0–10 scale). Rankings of 9–10 are considered ‘promoters’, 7–8 ‘passives’, and 0–6 ‘detractors’. Subtracting the percentage of detractors from that of promoters yields the NPS. Results: A cumulative total of 136 PsA pts had been registered to c@h by Sep 2017. Mean age at baseline was 52 years; the majority were female (69%). Prior biological DMARD exposure was 24%. The most common topics discussed on calls were treatment adherence (290 calls), CZP maintenance dose (284 calls) and syringe disposal (201 calls). The average length per call was 15.7 min (SD: 5.33) at the end of Week 0 (total: 135 calls), and 14.6 min (SD: 6.59) at the end of Week 52 (45 calls). Across indications, a cumulative total of 272/655 pts had either completed the coaching period (n= 70) or discontinued (n= 202) by 28 Sep 2017, of whom 106 rated the program. Of these, 87.5% gave promoter scores, 10.4% passive, and 3.8% detractor, yielding an NPS of 83.7. The program was still ongoing at the time of this data cut. Conclusions: c@h offers support and guidance to CZP-treated pts in Germany. Feedback from pts willing to provide a rating (39%) indicates a high level of satisfaction with the program. </P>

<P>Introduction: Psoriasis (PS) in women often overlaps with their peak reproductive years. Data on the family planning (FP) experience of patients (pts) are therefore needed to optimize PS management. Objectives: To report the results of a survey evaluating the FP needs of women with PS. Methods: Women of childbearing potential (WoCP; aged 18–45) diagnosed with PS (including pts with psoriatic arthritis), were recruited to complete a 96-question web-based survey on Sur</P>

<P>veyGizmo®. The survey included questions on pts’experience, </P>

<P>concerns and educational needs, and was disseminated using eblasts (the National Psoriasis Foundation, Advance E-News, and TalkPsoriasis.org mailing lists) and social media (Facebook and Twitter). Responses were collected Dec 2017–Feb 2018. Results: Of 141 pts completing the survey, 91 (65%) were planning to conceive (PTC), and 66 (47%) had experienced pregnancy (EP) within the last 5 years. Prescribed systemic medications were being used by 40% of pts PTC and 12% of pts who had EP. Only 41% pts who had EP informed the healthcare provider (HCP) treating their PS of their pregnancy right away, while 21% did not notify them at all. While PTC, most pts who had not EP (88%), sought FP advice from the internet; only 21% had consulted the HCP treating their PS, compared to 55% of pts who had EP. Of the 96 pts who discussed FP with the HCP treating their PS, just 7% said this was initiated by </P>

<P>theHCP.PtsPTCweremostinfluencedbytheirpersonalnetwork </P>

<P>(e.g. family), but of pts who had EP, 41% said the HCP treating </P>

<P>their PS was one of the most influential types of support in their </P>

<P>FP decisions. Pts reported wanting information on the impact of </P>

<P>PS and treatments on their baby, the heritability of PS, and flare </P>

<P>management during pregnancy. During pregnancy, 65% pts who had EP stopped treatment (of any type), 79% of whom did so out of fear of harming their baby. In 40% cases where pts had stopped all and any treatment for PSO, the decision was initiated by the pt, and in 47%, by their PS treatment provider. Of pts who stopped treatment, 44% experienced a worsening in the severity of their </P>

<P>PS, yet most pts do/did not have a plan for flare management </P>

<P>during pregnancy (PTC: 69%; EP: 65%). Many pts stopping all treatment had not been advised on restarting treatment post-partum (PTC: 42%; EP: 23%). Conclusions: Many WoCP with PS take systemic medications but many do not discuss FP with their PS treatment provider, and if they do, the discussion is rarely initiated by the HCP. PS treatment providers should prioritize discussing FP, and plan treatment around and during pregnancy. The educational needs of WoCP with PS include the impact of treatment on their baby, flare management during pregnancy, and restarting treatment post-partum.

<P>Introduction: Plaque psoriasis (PSO) can have a profound impact on patients’ (pts’) psychosocial wellbeing, leading to selfconsciousness, embarrassment, depression, social isolation and stigmatization. However, little is known of how the impact of disease differs between genders. Objective:To evaluate differences in the psychosocial impact of PSO on quality of life in men and women in early adulthood. </P>

<P>Methods: Ptsaged≥18intheUS,Canada,France,Germanyand </P>

<P>Italy without a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis were invited to complete a postal survey (Oct 2016–Jan 2017), in the ratio 3:1 as being treated with advanced therapy (biologic/apremilast), or eligible for but not yet receiving advanced therapy. Answers were given on 5- or 7-point Likert Scale. Percentages shown are proportions of pts responding using either of the two responses indicating greatest impact of disease. Data are presented for pts in </P>

<P>earlyadulthood (18–45 years),[1]stratifiedbygender. </P>

<P>Results: 63 women and 73 men completed the survey; mean age was 35 and 36 years, respectively, mean age at diagnosis was 28 for both genders. Disease distribution was similar between genders, although women reported more severe disease affecting their arms and males reported more severe scalp disease. Whilst physical impacts of disease were similar ( ≤ 2 pts reported severe problems with walking, washing/dressing, carrying out housework/family/ leisure activities or daily work), a higher proportion of women (14% vs 4%) reported severe/extreme pain or discomfort. Both genders were more concerned by appearance (women: 73%, men: 63%) than pain (women: 43%, men: 34%). A higher proportion of women than men were concerned by their appearance (73% vs 63%), reported a greater impact on their choice of clothing (37% vs 21%), and always/usually tried to cover their skin (27% vs 16%). Similarly, psychosocial effects of disease tended to be greater in women: 16% women vs 8% men reported severe/extreme anxiety or depression; 29% women vs 18% men suffered sexually/in achieving intimacy. Similar proportions had suffered at work (women: 11%, men: 16%), while a higher proportion of women (6%) than men (3%) struggled to </P>

<P>livetheirlivesastheydidpriortotheirdiagnosis.Thesefindings </P>

<P>have been corroborated by ethnography studies. Conclusion: Despite similar clinical manifestations of PSO, women in early adulthood tended to report a greater impact of their disease on their lives, both physically, in terms of pain, and psychosocially, in terms of effects on relationships and impact on their daily lives. Physician awareness of such gender differences in the impact of the disease on patients’ lives would encourage a more holistic approach to discussing treatment options with their patients. </P>

<P>Introduction: The WHO resolution 2014 raised fundamental demands for the health care system to increase the awareness for patients with chronic skin diseases such as psoriasis, including its </P>

<P>fightagainststigmatization.Singlememberstateswereencouraged </P>

<P>to take action on all levels, including public awareness campaigns. After a period of refusal, the German ministry of health approved a project submitted by German dermatologists, patient groups and further experts to develop interventions against stigmatization. Objectives- Aim of investigation: The project aims to develop and evaluate public interventions against stigmatization of people with visible skin diseases. Methods: The project consist of three phases. Within a one-year period current research will be processed through a systematic literature search; recommendations for intervention formats will be derived. The consecutive 18 months involve the development </P>

<P>of defined intervention formats. The interventions are supposed </P>

<P>to focus on locations of stigma and encounters of stigmatizing with stigmatized persons. Results: The application has been approved and is funded by the German ministry of health for a period of three years throughout the years 2018 to 2021. The project group consists of 25 dermatology-, science- and patient-experts who work in operative groups in order to develop the content and the intervention format. In doing so, different levels of the stigmatization process, namely stereotypes, prejudice, discrimination are considered as important aspects and will be accounted for in the development of the intervention. First results of the literature review imply that people with visible skin disease such as psoriasis are affected by stigmatization in several dimensions and strategies for reducing the stigma are required. Conclusion: Following the WHO resolution, this project is an example for successful project initiation of an interdisciplinary team to develop and implement an intervention against stigmatization. </P>

<P>the current Global Burden of Disease concept, which markedly underestimates the patient burden of skin diseases. Objective:The objective of the GRIDD research project is to develop a comprehensive measure of the impact of living with skin diseases instruments by country, regionally and worldwide. The global instrument, developed with patient organisations, will capture patient experiences, including the extent of disease impact and burden for patients and their families, for generic (i.e. </P>

<P>all dermatological diseases) and specific dermatological disease </P>

<P>including psoriasis assessment worldwide. Materials + Methods: Development of the comprehensive measure of impact of disease will be based on a novel methodology with several phases.

<P>phase 2. The GRIDD research team, including researcher from the University Medical Center in Hamburg and University of Cardiff, met in 2017 to start phases 1 and 2. The systematic literature review on “Existing patient-centred outcome measures currently used in dermatology” is currently underway. Conclusion: This novel patient-centric methodology will complement existing concepts of evaluating patient perspective in dermatology. GRIDD will provide an extended patient view for better decision making in dermatology on a global and country level. It supports local, regional and international attempts to create awareness, better position psoriasis and other skin diseases and encourage decision-makers and stakeholders to include dermatological diseases in their policies. </P>

<P>TREATMENT OF NAIL PSORIASIS WITH DIFFERENT PULSE DURATIONS OF PULSED DYE LASER </P>

<P>Mohamad Goldust1, Homan Alipour2 1Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, 2Tabriz University of Medical Sciences </P>

<P>Background: There are different treatment modalities for nail psoriasis but the treatment of choice is still controversial. Laser therapy opened new windows for treatment of nail psoriasis (1,2). </P>

<P>Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of </P>

<P>different pulse durations in the treatment of nail psoriasis with the 595-nm PDL to determine the optimal pulse duration. Methods: Inthisclinicaltrialstudy,120patientswithbilateralfingernail psoriasis were evaluated. PDL was applied on the proximal and lateral nailfolds based on random assignment. 240 nails were treated with 6-millisecond pulse duration and 9 J/cm(2) whereas 240 nails were treated with 0.45-millisecond pulse duration and 6 J/ cm(2). Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) was used to assess the clinical outcome from pretreatment and posttreatment photographs. Results: After 6 months of first treatment, there was a significant reduction in overall NAPSI, nail matrix NAPSI, and nail bed NAPSI scores from baseline in both groups; however, no </P>

<P>significant difference was found between the two pulse duration </P>

<P>groups. Side effects were mild including transient petechiae and hyperpigmentation. Conclusion: PDL was found to be an effective and well-tolerated option in the treatment of nail psoriasis. This study demonstrated that both the longer 6-millisecond and shorter 0.45-millisecond pulses of PDL (595 nm) have been clinically proven to be effective for the treatment of nail matrix and nail bed psoriasis. </P>

<P>who used the term psoriasis, but only for an itchy, scaly eruption of the eyelids and scrotum, that was probably seborrheic dermatitis. Unfortunately, little was known about the origin of the disease for hundreds of years, in the darkness of the Middle Age - a period of stagnation, and many psoriasis sufferers were thought at the time to have leprosy. Because so little was known about contraction and treatment, psoriasis patients were often separated from the general population for fear of them contaminating others. People with psoriasis – thousands in medieval Europe – were forced to warn others of their arrival by ringing a clapper. It wasn’t until the early 1800’s that psoriasis was determined to be a condition separate from leprosy. In the cultural movement of Renaissance some authors mentioned the diseases psora and lepra in their books. In the 18th century hospitals or dispensaries were opened only for treatment of skin or venereal diseases giving to the physicians the opportunity to study more cases of skin diseases and psoriasis as well, while the end of the 19th century psoriatic micro morphology was already described. In 20th century many authors studied the genetic alteration, and today there is undisputed evidence that the disease is multifactorial. </P>

<P>Brigham and Women’s Hospital Introduction: Inverse (intertriginous) psoriasis is an underdiagnosed, often untreated phenotype of psoriasis (PsO) with a high burden of illness. Inverse PsO may occur in up to 23% of subjects with psoriasis, higher than previously reported. Objectives: To characterize the frequency of inverse PsO and patient characteristics and their treatment in a large commercial insurance claims database. Methods: We used longitudinal claims data from commercially insured patients in the US between 10/2015 and 12/2016 to identify </P>

<P>adultswithadiagnosisofflexuralpsoriasis(ICD-10-CM:L40.8, “otherpsoriasis” which is “recommendedtobe usedfor flexural </P>

<P>day enrollment period was required before the first diagnosis of </P>

<P>AD. Among those diagnosed we computed the risk of initiating immunomodulating medications during the following 6 months. All analyses were conducted using the Aetion Evidence Platform.

Of those, 0.3% generalized pustular, 0.5% guttate, and 0.2% pustulosis palmaris et plantaris. Prevalent comorbidities included depression (7%), anxiety (6.5%), and cardiovascular conditions (5%). 20% received antidepressants. Within 180 days after the </P>

<P>DEVELOPMENT OF THE “PSO SLEEPYQ” AND THE “PSA SLEEPYQ”: TWO QUESTIONNAIRES TO CHARACTERIZE SLEEP IN PATIENTS WITH PSORIATIC DISEASE </P>

<P>Lourdes Perez-Chada </P>

<P>Harvard Medical School - Brigham and Women’s Hospital Introduction: Substantial evidence suggests that psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are independently associated with sleep disturbance, which may result in serious health consequences including cardiovascular events and mortality. However, the validity of the sleep measures used in these studies is unknown as they have not been validated in patients with psoriatic disease or included psoriatic patients during their development process. </P>

<P>There is a need for validated disease-specific Patient-Reported </P>

<P>Outcome Measures (PROMs) to accurately characterize sleep in this population and to measure the effect of psoriatic therapies on sleep disturbance. Objectives: This study aimed to develop and establish the content validity of 2 new sleep PROMs: the “PsO Sleepy-Q” and the “PsA Sleepy-Q”. Methods: Following FDA PROM-development guidance, our study: (i) hypothesized a conceptual framework and identified domains through literature review and patient semi-structured interviews using a saturation model (n= 30); (ii) rated domains for importance by patients (n= 42) and an international expert panel including dermatologists, rheumatologists and sleep experts (n= 45); (iii) selected final domains based of the patients’preference; (iv) generated item pools and the preliminary versions of the instruments. Results: Psoriatic patients reported that sleep maintenance, adequacy, quantity and quality were the most important aspects of disordered sleep. Regarding causes of disturbed sleep: itch, skin and joint pain, stiffness, taking care of psoriatic lesions before bedtime, worsening of psoriatic symptoms at night, feeling uncomfortable in bed due to PsA and sleep apneawere the most outstanding factors selected. Finally, patients reported that disturbed sleep may increase psoriatic signs and symptomsas well as fatigue, cognitive impairment and psychological stress. Overall, patients with PsA expressed a higher burden of sleep disturbance compared to patients with PsO. Preliminary versions of the “PsO Sleepy-Q” and “PsA Sleepy-Q” including 18 and 24 items, respectively, were created. These questionnaires intend to measure the degree of sleep disturbance, the potential causes of sleep disturbance and the impairment related to sleep disturbance. Conclusion: This study establishes the content validity of the “PsO Sleepy-Q” and “PsA Sleepy-Q”, two patient-derived PROMs to characterize sleep in patients with psoriatic disease in research and clinical settings. These questionnaires will undergo cognitive </P>

<P>UNSTABLE FORMS OF PSORIASIS – INDICATOR OF AN INTERMEDIATE STATE OF SYSTEMIC DISEASE </P>

<P>Florentina-Silvia Delli State Hospital for Skin and Venereal Diseases - Hippokratia General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece </P>

<P>Introduction: Erytrodermic psoriasis, inverse psoriasis and generalized pustular psoriasis are considered three particular clinical forms of psoriasis. Objectives: We present two clinical cases in which it is discussed the possibility of considering these clinical pictures as a manifestation of the immunological switch of psoriasis from an organ-target (skin or joint) disease, to a systemic form of psoriasis. Methods: A 22-year-old-man with erythodermic psoriasis and a history of inverse psoriasis since childhood was successfully treated with 60 mg acitretin, until the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis at the age of 26. The presence of arthritis determined us to change the therapy. Secukinumab at the classic therapeutic scheme is keeping the patient’s skin clean of psoriatic lesions, except from the armpits, and without any arthritic symptoms. A 75-year-old-woman with psoriatic arthritis and hyperkeratotic palms and soles non</P>

<P>specific lesions, under infliximab therapy presented generalized </P>

<P>pustular psoriasis. After 3 months of acitretin 40mg and etanercept at the classic dose, the patient remains free of any symptoms. Conclusions: The majority of psoriasis studies focus on chronic plaque psoriasis. We sustain the opinion that the above unstable forms of psoriasis, usually impossible to diagnose by other specialities than Dermatology, should be consider the main step in multidisciplinary approach of psoriasis as a systemic disease. </P>

<P>COULD BIOLOGICAL AGENTS FOSTER SUICIDE THROUGH ITS POTENTIAL ANTIDEPRESSANT MECHANISM? A PSYCHODERMATOLOGICAL APPROACH </P>

<P>Estela M Malatesta Dermatologist and Psychiatrist, Doctor. Arturo Ameghino Mental Health Centre, Buenos Aires, Argentina. President of ADEPSI, Academy of Dermatology and Psychiatry </P>

<P>Introduction: Depression and Psoriasis are associated in up to 60% of the cases, with an increased risk of attempted and completed suicide in patients with severe forms of the disease. Bipolar Disorder is a biological condition that affects between 2 and 5% of the population, being an important cause of disability in the world. In spite of this, Bipolar Disorder is often underdiagnosed as Unipolar Depression, which increases the possibility of prescribing errors, as it occurs when administering only antidepressant agents without accompanying them with mood stabilizers, fostering the appearance of episodes of inverse polarity (SWITCHING) which, in turn, raises the risk of suicide. Objectives: The “Cytokine Hypothesis” as a cause of depression suggests the association between the immune system and depression through the induction of the indolamine 2, 3- dioxygenase enzyme. The objectives of the poster are: </P>

<P>• To raise the need for new studies to confirm this hypothesis as </P>

<P>well as the antidepressant effect of biological agents and their potential ability to cause a shift into mania. </P>

<P>•Todeepenthecriteriaforpatientselectionforbothscientificand </P>

<P>therapeutic protocols. Methods: This poster reviews the literature for evidence that while biological agents could improve the mood of patients with psoriasis treated with these drugs, this same favourable antidepressant effect on humor may trigger a switch of mood into mania, favouring attempted and completed suicide in undiagnosed bipolar patients treated for psoriasis with IL17-TNF alpha cytokine blockers. Results: Evidence gathered so far suggests that common inflammatory processes could underpin both bipolar and psoriasis. The current literature is lacking of longitudinal and mechanistic studies, as well as comparison studies to explore the magnitude of this relation. Conclusion: Considering both bipolar disorder and psoriasis as a multi-system disorder should help us understand the common physiopathology of this comorbidity so as not to see them as separated disorders. Consequently, it is vital to emphasize the importance of the initial psychiatric evaluation for a correct psychiatric/ clinical diagnosis for patients with Psoriasis to be both admitted to a strict control protocol and treated with biological agents. </P>

<P>TREATING THE PAIN, NOT THE PROBLEM? RESULTS FROM A SWEDISH ONLINE SURVEY ON PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS AND PSORIASIS WITH JOINT PAIN </P>

<P>T Norgren, B Bohannan Psoriasisförbundet, Stockholm, Sweden Introduction: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory </P>

<P>disease associated with psoriasis, that can cause pain, swelling and, if untreated, severe joint destruction and disability. The knowledge about PsA among both the public and healthcare providers is limited, leading to both underdiagnosis and undertreatment. To raise awareness of PsA and gather relevant data, the Swedish Psoriasis Association (Psoriasisförbundet) and the Swedish Rheumatism Association (Reumatikerförbundet) initiated an educational awareness campaign on a well-visited online health information platform, which also featured a survey on healthcare experiences and Quality of Life. Objectives: The purpose of the survey was to identify gaps or discrepancies in the healthcare provided for individuals diagnosed with PsA and for individuals with psoriasis and joint pain consistent with a PsA diagnosis, as well as understanding the impact on QoL for both groups. Methods: The survey consisted of two questionnaires, one for individuals diagnosed with PsA, group A, and one for individuals diagnosed with psoriasis who have joint pain consistent with a PsA diagnosis (using CASPAR criteria as reference), group </P>

<P>B. The survey was open from April 6 2017 to March 31 2018. The total number of respondents in group A was 5 201, and in group B 11 272. It was not mandatory to answer all questions in the survey. One section of the survey focussed on prescribed </P>

<P>medication,tospecificallyidentifydiscrepanciesinthetreatment </P>

<P>of the diagnosed (A) and undiagnosed (B) groups. Limitations: self-reported diagnosis, possible to take survey multiple times using different devices. Results: In response to the question “Which medication has been prescribed for your joint pain during the past year?” 23.91% of group B (214 of 895) answered that they had been prescribed opioid pain medication for their joint pain. In group A only 4.61% of the respondents (73 out of 1 582) were prescribed opioid pain medication for their PsA. Conclusions: The results show a large discrepancy between the groups in the prescription of opioid pain medication. The results suggest that individuals with psoriasis that have joint pain consistent with a PsA diagnosis are being over-prescribed potentially addictive pain medication rather than receiving treatment for their </P>

<P>underlyingconditionorinflammatorysymptomsapartfrompain. </P>

<P>As early diagnosis and effective treatment is vital to slow down disease progression, individuals with psoriasis as well as healthcare providers need to be educated on symptoms and diagnosis criteria of PsA to prevent undertreatment or treatment that may even be harmful.

<P>Harvard Medical School-Brigham and Women’s Hospital Introduction: The International Dermatology Outcome Measures (IDEOM) group was established to standardize patient-centered outcome measures to improve the assessment of treatment respon</P>

<P>seanddiseasecourseindermatology.Todefinethemeasurement setforpsoriasis,IDEOMhasinitiallydefinedasetofdomainsto </P>

<P>be measured in all psoriasis clinical trials representing a “Core Domain Set”. “Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) Symptoms” is part of this set. Objectives: To achieve consensus on whether patients enrolling </P>

<P>in a psoriasis clinical trial should first be screened for PsA and </P>

<P>then with which measure their PsA symptoms should be assessed. Methods: Following the OMERACT (Outcome Measures in Rheumatology) Filter 2.0, the COSMIN guidelines, and based upon the feedback from a consensus meeting held at the IDEOM 2017 Annual Meeting, we conducted an international, multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder on-line Delphi survey. The survey was organized into 3 parts in which participants were asked to </P>

<P>(1) vote on the role of PsA screening in psoriasis trials, (2) vote on the quality (measurement properties) of 4 patient-reported instruments: Patient Global (PG)-arthritis associated to a pain assessment tool, PG-Psoriatic Arthritis (PG-PsA) associated to a pain assessment tool, Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data-3 (RAPID3), and Psoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease 9 (PsAID9), and (3) rank these instruments in order of importance.Additionally, respondents were invited to provide feedback on the survey. Results: A total of n= 293, n= 233 and n= 218 subjects completed the PsA screening, instrument quality assessment, and ranking sections of the survey, respectively. The group was comprised of rheumatologists (44.5%), dermatologists (26%), patients (7.5%), industry partners (8.9%), dermatologist-rheumatologists (5.1%), and patient association representatives (3.4%). Results showed that 90%of participants agreed that all patients enrolling in a psoriasis trial should be screened for PsA. Regarding the quality of the </P>

<P>instruments, only the PsAID9reached the pre-specified endpoint </P>

<P>of &gt; 70% with agreement that the instrument has good-to-excellent validity, feasibility, reliability and responsiveness; &lt; 15% agreed that the quality of the instrument is poor or that there is not enough information to make an informed decision. In the ranking exercise, </P>

<P>PsAID9 was the first choice(voted by 48% of respondents) and </P>

<P>RAPID3 represented an acceptable alternative second choice (voted by 33% of respondents). Conclusion: In this Delphi study, most participants agreed that all psoriasis trial participants should be screened for PsA. Regarding the measurement set for “PsA Symptoms”, PsAID9 was selected as the most appropriate measure, while RAPID3 could be an acceptable alternative to PsAID9. This will be followed by a workshop at the IDEOM and GRAPPA 2018 annual meetings to review discussion points as well as any need for a second Delphi round. </P>

<P>THE IMPACT OF A DIAGNOSIS ON THE PATIENTS’ PERCEPTION OF TREATMENT AND CARE. RESULTS FROM AN ONLINE SURVEY ON PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS AND PSORIASIS WITH JOINT PAIN </P>

<P>T Norgren, B Bohannan Psoriasisförbundet, Stockholm, Sweden Introduction: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory </P>

<P>joint disease that, if untreated, can cause joint destruction and disability. The knowledge about PsA among both public and healthcare providers is limited, leading to underdiagnosis and undertreatment. To raise awareness of PsA and gather relevant data, the Swedish Psoriasis Association and the Swedish Rheumatism Association initiated a web-based educational campaign which also featured a survey on healthcare experiences and Quality of Life. Objectives: The purpose of the survey was to identify the gaps in the healthcare provided for individuals diagnosed with PsA and individuals with psoriasis and joint pain consistent with a PsA diagnosis, as well as understanding the impact on QoL for both groups. Method: The survey consisted of two questionnaires, one for individuals diagnosed with PsA, group A, and one for individuals diagnosed with psoriasis who have joint pain consistent with a PsA diagnosis (using CASPAR criteria), group B. The survey was open from April 6 2017 to March 31 2018. One section of the survey focussed on time to diagnosis and perception of healthcare. Limitations: self-reported diagnosis, possible to take survey multiple times using different devices. Results: Both groups had seen multiple doctors for their joint pain. In group A 60% (n= 1 132) had seen &gt; 4 doctors, with 11% reporting having seen &gt; 10. In group B 52.5% (n= 824) had seen &gt; 4 doctors, with 8% having seen &gt; 10. In group A nearly 51% (n= 1 211) reported having had joint pain/symptoms for at least 1 year before receiving a diagnosis, with 12% waiting &gt; 10 years. In group B 91% (n= 1 872) reported having had joint pain/ symptoms for at least 1 year, with 35% at &gt; 10 years. Perception of healthcare differed greatly between the groups. In group A over half (n= 1 273) reported that their perception of healthcare improved or improved greatly after receiving their PsA diagnosis. In group B nearly 78% (n= 1 227) reported be</P>

<P>ing dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the care they receive. </P>

<P>Conclusions: The results show that the group with a PsA diagnosis have a much more positive perception of the treatment and care they receive than the group without a diagnosis. Interestingly, in another part of the survey group B reported their psoriasis having a low to medium impact on their lives, indicating that their psoriasis may be mild enough to be treated in a primary care setting only. In the past few years there have been extensive efforts put into educating Swedish dermatologists on recognizing early signs of PsA, but steps should also be taken to raise awareness of psoriasisassociated joint pain among general practitioners to ensure timely referral to specialist care.
